<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>SALLY CREIGHTON</h3>
</div>

<p>The frost outside was bitter, and the prairie which rolled
back from Lander&#8217;s in long undulations to the far horizon,
gleamed white beneath the moon, but there was
warmth and brightness in Stukely&#8217;s wooden barn. The
barn stood at one end of the little, desolate settlement,
where the trail that came up from the railroad thirty
miles away forked off into two wavy ribands melting into
a waste of snow. Lander&#8217;s consisted then of five or six
frame houses and stores, a hotel of the same material,
several sod stables, and a few birch-log barns; and its
inhabitants considered it one of the most promising places
in Western Canada. That, however, is the land of promise,
a promise which is in due time usually fulfilled, and
the men of Lander&#8217;s were, for the most part, shrewdly
practical optimists. They made the most of a somewhat
grim and frugal present, and staked all they had to give&mdash;the
few dollars they had brought in with them, and their
powers of enduring toil&mdash;upon the roseate future.
</p>
<p>Stukely had given them, and their scattered neighbors,
who had driven there across several leagues of
prairie, a supper in his barn. A big rusty stove, brought
in for the occasion, stood in the center of the barn floor.
Its pipe glowed in places a dull red, and now and then
Stukely wondered uneasily whether it was charring a
larger hole through the shingles of the roof. On one
side of the stove the floor had been cleared; on the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
benches, empty barrels and tables were huddled together,
and such of the guests as were not dancing at the moment,
sat upon the various substitutes for chairs. A keg
of hard Ontario cider had been provided for the refreshment
of the guests, and it was open to anybody to ladle
up what he wanted with a tin dipper. A haze of tobacco
smoke drifted in thin blue wisps beneath the big nickeled
lamps, and in addition to the reek of it, the place was
filled with the smell of hot iron which an over-driven
stove gives out, and the subtle odors of old skin coats.
</p>
<p>The guests, however, were accustomed to an atmosphere
of that kind, and it did not trouble them. For the most
part, they were lean, spare, straight of limb and bronzed
by frost and snow-blink, for though scarcely half of
them were Canadian born, the prairie, as a rule, swiftly
sets its stamp upon the newcomer. Also, there was something
in the way they held themselves and put their feet
down that suggested health and vigor, and, in the case
of most of them, a certain alertness and decision of character.
Some were from English cities, a few from those
of Canada, and some from the bush of Ontario; but there
was a similarity among them for which the cut and tightness
of their store clothing did not altogether account.
They lived well, though plainly, and toiled out in the
open unusually hard. Their eyes were steady, their
bronzed skin was clear, and their laughter had a wholesome
ring.
</p>
<p>A fiery-haired Scot, a Highlander, sat upon a barrel-head
sawing at a fiddle, and the shrill scream of it filled
the barn. To tone he did not aspire, but he played with
Caledonian nerve and swing, and kept the snapping time.
It was mad, harsh music of the kind that sets the blood
tingling, causes the feet to move in rhythm, though the
exhilarating effect of it was rather spoiled by the efforts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
of the little French Canadian who had another fiddle and
struck clanging chords from the lower strings.
</p>
<p>In the cleared space they were dancing what was presumably
a quadrille, though it bore almost as great a resemblance
to a Scottish country dance, or indeed to one
of the measures of rural France, which was, however,
characteristic of the present country.
</p>
<p>The Englishman has set no distinguishable impress
upon the prairie. It has absorbed him with his reserve
and sturdy industry, and apparently the Canadian from
the cities is also lost in it, too, for his is the leaven that
works through the mass slowly and unobtrusively, while
the Scot and the habitant of French extraction have given
the life of it color and individuality. Extremes meet
and fuse on the wide white levels of the West.
</p>
<p>An Englishman, however, was the life of that dance,
and he was physically a larger man than most of the rest,
for, as a rule, the Colonial born run to wiry hardness
rather than to solidity of frame. Gregory Hawtrey was
tall and thick of shoulder, though the rest of him was in
fine modeling, and he had a pleasant face of the English
blue-eyed type. Just then it was shining with boyish merriment,
and indeed an irresponsible gayety was a salient
characteristic of the man. One would have called him
handsome, though his mouth was a trifle slack, and though
a certain assurance in his manner just fell short of swagger.
He was the kind of man one likes at first sight, but
for all that not the kind his hard-bitten neighbors would
have chosen to stand by them through the strain of
drought and frost in adverse seasons.
</p>
<p>As it happened, the grim, hard-faced Sager, who had
come there from Michigan, was just then talking about
him to Stukely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of tone about that man&mdash;guess he once had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
gold-leaf on him quite thick, and it hasn&#8217;t all worn off
yet,&#8221; said Sager. &#8220;Seen more Englishmen like him,
and some folks from Noo York, too, when I took parties
bass fishing way back yonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He waved his hand vaguely, as though to indicate the
American Republic, and Stukely agreed with him. They
were right as far as they went, for Hawtrey undoubtedly
possessed a grace of manner which, however, somehow
failed to reach distinction. It was, perhaps, just a little
too apparent, and lacked the strengthening feature of
restraint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; remarked Stukely reflectively, &#8220;what
those kind of fellows done before they came out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had expressed a curiosity which is now and then
to be met with on the prairie, but Sager, the charitable,
grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he responded, &#8220;I guess quite a few done no
more than make their folks on the other side tired of
them, and that&#8217;s why they sent them out to you. Some of
them get paid so much on condition that they don&#8217;t come
back again. Say&#8221;&mdash;and he glanced toward the dancers&mdash;&#8220;Dick
Creighton&#8217;s Sally seems quite stuck on Hawtrey
by the way she&#8217;s looking at him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stukely assented. He was a somewhat primitive person,
as was Sally Creighton, for that matter, and he did
not suppose that she would have been greatly offended
had she overheard his observations.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve thought that, too. If she wants
him she&#8217;ll get him. She&#8217;s a smart girl&mdash;Sally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There were not many women present&mdash;perhaps one to
every two of the men, which was rather a large proportion
in that country, and their garments were not at all
costly or beautiful. The fabrics were, for the most part,
the cheapest obtainable, and the wearers had fashioned
their gowns with their own fingers, in the scanty interludes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
between washing, and baking, and mending their
husbands&#8217; or fathers&#8217; clothes. The faces of the women
were a trifle sallow and had lost their freshness in the dry
heat of the stove. Their hands were hard and reddened,
and in figure most of them were thin and spare. One
could have fancied that in a land where everybody toiled
strenuously their burden was heavier than the men&#8217;s. One
or two of the women clearly had been accustomed to a
smoother life, but there was nothing to suggest that they
looked back to it with regret. As a matter of fact, they
looked forward, working for the future, and there was
patient courage in their smiling eyes.
</p>
<p>Creighton&#8217;s Sally, who was then tripping through the
measure on Hawtrey&#8217;s arm, was native born. She was
young and straight&mdash;straighter in outline than the women
of the cities&mdash;with a suppleness which was less suggestive
of the willow than a rather highly-tempered spring. She
moved with a large vigor which barely fell short of grace,
her eyes snapped when she smiled at Hawtrey, and her
hair, which was of a ruddy brown, had fiery gleams in it.
Anyone would have called her comely, and there were,
indeed, no women in Stukely&#8217;s barn to compare with her
in that respect, a fact that she recognized.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Sager reflectively; &#8220;she&#8217;ll get him
sure if she sets her mind on it, and there&#8217;s no denying
that they make a handsome pair. I&#8217;ve nothing against
Hawtrey either: a straight man, a hustler, and smart at
handling a team. Still, it&#8217;s kind of curious that while
the man&#8217;s never been stuck for the stamps like the rest
of us, he&#8217;s made nothing very much of his homestead yet.
Now there&#8217;s Bob, and Jake, and Jasper came in after he
did with half the money, and they thrash out four bushels
of hard wheat for Hawtrey&#8217;s three.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Stukely made a little gesture of concurrence, for he
dimly realized the significance of his companion&#8217;s speech.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
It is results which count in that country, where the one
thing demanded is practical efficiency, and the man of
simple, steadfast purpose usually goes the farthest. Hawtrey
had graces which won him friends, boldness of conception,
and the power of application; but he had somehow
failed to accomplish as much as his neighbors did.
After all, there must be a good deal to be said for the
man who raises four bushels of good wheat where his
comrade with equal facilities raises three.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Hawtrey was talking to Sally, and it
was not astonishing that they talked of farming, which
is the standard topic on that strip of prairie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re not going to break that new piece this
spring?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Hawtrey; &#8220;I&#8217;d want another team,
anyway, and I can&#8217;t raise the money; it&#8217;s hard to get out
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty under the sod,&#8221; declared Sally, who was essentially
practical. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we get ours, but you
have to put the breaker in and turn it over. You&#8221;&mdash;and
she flashed a quick glance at him&mdash;&#8220;got most of
yours from England. Won&#8217;t they send you any more?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey&#8217;s eyes twinkled as he shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid they won&#8217;t,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve put the
screw on them rather hard the last few years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you do that?&#8221; Sally inquired. &#8220;Told them
you were thinking of coming home again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a certain wryness in the young man&#8217;s smile,
for though Hawtrey had cast no particular slur upon
the family&#8217;s credit he had signally failed to enhance it,
and he was quite aware that his English relatives did not
greatly desire his presence in the Old Country.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you really shouldn&#8217;t hit a fellow
in the eye that way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>As it happened, he did not see the girl&#8217;s face just then,
or he might have noticed a momentary change in its
expression. Gregory Hawtrey was a little casual in
speech, but, so far, most of the young women upon whom
he bestowed an epithet indicative of affection had attached
no significance to it. They had wisely decided that he
did not mean anything.
</p>
<p>The Scottish fiddler&#8217;s voice broke in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can ye no&#8217; watch the music? Noo it&#8217;s paddy-bash!&#8221;
he cried.
</p>
<p>His French Canadian comrade waved his fiddle-bow
protestingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Paddybashy! <i>V&#8217;la la belle chose!</i>&#8221; he exclaimed
with ineffable contempt, and broke in upon the ranting
melody with a succession of harsh, crashing chords.
</p>
<p>Then began a contest as to which could drown the
other&#8217;s instrument, and the snapping time grew faster,
until the dancers gasped, and men who wore long boots
encouraged them with cries and stamped a staccato accompaniment
upon the benches or on the floor. It was
savage, rasping music, but one player infused into it the
ebullient nerve of France, and the other was from the
misty land where the fiddler learns the witchery of the
clanging reel and the swing of the Strathspey. It is
doubtless not high art, but there is probably no music in
the world that fires the blood like this and turns the sober
dance to rhythmic riot. Perhaps, too, amid the prairie
snow, it gains something that gives it a closer compelling
grip.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey was breathless when it ceased, and Sally&#8217;s
eyes flashed with the effulgence of the Northern night
when her partner found her a resting-place upon an upturned
barrel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;I won&#8217;t have any cider.&#8221; She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
turned and glanced at him imperiously. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
going for any more either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was, no doubt, not the speech a well-trained English
maiden would have made, but, though Hawtrey smiled
rather curiously, it fell inoffensively from Sally&#8217;s lips.
Though it is not always set down to their credit, the
brown-faced, hard-handed men as a rule live very abstemiously
in that country, and, as it happened, Hawtrey,
who certainly showed no sign of it, had already consumed
rather more cider than anybody else. He made a little
bow of submission, and Sally resumed their conversation
where it had broken off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could let you have our ox-team to do that breaking
with,&#8221; she volunteered. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had Sproatly living
with you all winter. Why don&#8217;t you make him stay
and work out his keep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed. &#8220;Sally,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do you think
anybody could make Sproatly work?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be hard,&#8221; the girl admitted, and then looked
up at him with a little glint in her eyes. &#8220;Still, I&#8217;d
put a move on him if you sent him along to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was a capable young woman, but Hawtrey was
dubious concerning her ability to accomplish such a task.
Sproatly was an Englishman of good education, though
his appearance seldom suggested it. Most of the summer
he drove about the prairie in a wagon, vending cheap
oleographs and patent medicines, and during the winter
contrived to obtain free quarters from his bachelor acquaintances.
It is a hospitable country, but there were
men round Lander&#8217;s who, when they went away to work in
far-off lumber camps, as they sometimes did, nailed up
their doors and windows to prevent Sproatly from getting
in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he never do anything?&#8221; Sally added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Hawtrey assured her, &#8220;at least, never when he
can help it. He had, however, started something shortly
before I left him. You see, the house has needed cleaning,
the last month or two, and we tossed up for who
should do it. It fell to Sproatly, who didn&#8217;t seem quite
pleased, but he got as far as firing the chairs and tables
out into the snow. Then he sat down for a smoke, and
he was looking at them through the window when I drove
away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; commented Sally, &#8220;you want somebody to keep
the house straight and look after you. Didn&#8217;t you know
any nice girls back there in the Old Country?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spoke naturally, and there was nothing to show
that the girl&#8217;s heart beat a little more rapidly than usual
as she watched Hawtrey. His face, however, grew a trifle
graver, for she had touched upon a momentous question
to such men as he. Living in Spartan simplicity upon
the prairie, there are a good many of them, well-trained,
well-connected young Englishmen, and others like them
from Canadian cities. They naturally look for some
grace of culture or refinement in the woman they would
marry, and there are few women of the station to which
they once belonged who could face the loneliness and unassisted
drudgery that must be borne by the small wheat-grower&#8217;s
wife. There were also reasons why this question
had been troubling Hawtrey in particular of late.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course, I knew nice girls in England, one
or two,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure, however, that
girls of that kind would find things even moderately comfortable
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A certain reflectiveness in his tone, which seemed to
indicate that he had already given the matter some consideration,
jarred upon Sally. Moreover, she had an
ample share of the Western farmer&#8217;s pride, which firmly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
declines to believe that there is any land to compare with
the one the plow is slowly wresting from the wide white
levels of the prairie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We make out well enough,&#8221; she asserted with a snap
in her eyes.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey made an expressive gesture. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he
admitted, &#8220;it&#8217;s in you. All you want in order to beat
the wilderness and turn it into a garden is an ax, a span
of oxen, and a breaker plow. You ought to be proud of
your energy. Still, you see, our folks back yonder aren&#8217;t
quite the same as you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally partly understood him. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; she replied,
&#8220;they want more, and, perhaps, they&#8217;re used to having
more than we have; but isn&#8217;t that in one way their misfortune?
Is it what folks want, or what they can do,
that makes them of use to anybody else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a hard truth in her suggestion, but Hawtrey,
who seldom occupied himself with matters of that
kind, smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know; but, after all, it
wouldn&#8217;t be worth while for us to raise wheat here unless
there were folks back East to eat it, and, if some of them
only eat in the shape of dainty cakes, that doesn&#8217;t affect
the question. Anyway, there will be but another dance
or two, and I was wondering whether I could drive you
home; I&#8217;ve got Wyllard&#8217;s Ontario sleigh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally glanced at him rather sharply. She had half-expected
this offer, and it is possible would have judiciously
led him up to it if he had not made it. Now, as she saw
that he really wished to drive her home, she was glad
that she had not deliberately encouraged the invitation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered softly, &#8220;I think you could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Hawtrey, &#8220;if you&#8217;ll wait ten minutes
I&#8217;ll be back with the team.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SALLY TAKES CHARGE</h3>
</div>

<p>The night was clear and bitterly cold when Hawtrey and
Sally Creighton drove away from Stukely&#8217;s barn. Winter
had lingered unusually long that year, and the prairie
gleamed dimly white, with the sledge trail cutting athwart
it, a smear of blue-gray in the foreground. It was&mdash;for
Lander&#8217;s lay behind them with the snow among the
stubble belts that engirdled it&mdash;an empty wilderness that
the mettlesome team swung across, and during the first
few minutes the cold struck through the horses with a
sting like the thrust of steel. A half moon, coppery red
with frost, hung low above the snow-covered earth, and
there was no sound but the crunch beneath the runners,
and the beat of hoofs that rang dully through the silence
like a roll of muffled drums.
</p>
<p>Sleighs like the one that Hawtrey drove are not common
on the prairie, where the farmer generally uses the
humble bob-sled when the snow lies unusually long. It
had been made for use in Montreal, and bought back East
by a friend of Hawtrey&#8217;s, who was possessed of some
means, which is a somewhat unusual thing in the case of
a Western wheat-grower. This man also had bought the
team&mdash;the fastest he could obtain&mdash;and when the warmth
came back to the horses Hawtrey and the girl became conscious
of the exhilaration of the swift and easy motion.
The sleigh was light and narrow, and Hawtrey, who drew
the thick driving-robe higher about Sally, did not immediately
draw the mittened hand he had used back again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
The girl did not resent the fact that it still rested behind
her shoulder, nor did Hawtrey attach any particular significance
to the fact. He was a man who usually acted
on impulse. How far Sally understood him did not appear,
but she came of folk who had waged a stubborn
battle with the wilderness, and there was a vein of grim
tenacity in her.
</p>
<p>She was, however, conscious that there was something
beneath her feet which forced her, if she was to sit comfortably,
rather close against her companion; and it
seemed expedient to point it out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you move a little? I can&#8217;t get my feet fixed
right,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey looked down at her with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I can&#8217;t unless I get right outside. Aren&#8217;t you happy
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the kind of speech he was in the habit of making,
but there was rather more color in the girl&#8217;s face
than the stinging night air brought there, and she glanced
at the bottom of the sleigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sack of some kind, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Hawtrey answered, &#8220;it&#8217;s a couple of three-bushel
bags. Some special seed Lorton sent to Winnipeg
for. Ormond brought them out from the railroad.
I promised I&#8217;d take them along to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have told me. It&#8217;s most a league round
by Lorton&#8217;s place,&#8221; Sally returned with reproach in her
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t take long with this team. Have you any
great objections to another fifteen minutes&#8217; drive with
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally looked up at him, and the moonlight was on her
face, which was unusually pretty in the radiance of the
brilliant night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spoke demurely, but there was a perceptible something
in her voice which might have warned the man,
had he been in the habit of taking warning from anything,
which, however, was not the case. It was one of
his weaknesses that he seldom thought about what he did
until he was compelled to face the consequences; and it
was, perhaps, to his credit that he had after all done very
little harm, for there was hot blood in him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to grumble about
those extra three miles, but you were asking what land
I meant to break this spring. What put that into your
mind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our folks,&#8221; Sally replied candidly. &#8220;They were talking
about you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This again was significant, but Hawtrey did not
notice it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt they said I ought to tackle the new
quarter section,&#8221; he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Sally. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it? Last
fall you thrashed out quite a big harvest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did. There, however, didn&#8217;t seem to be
many dollars left over when I&#8217;d faced the bills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl made a little gesture of impatience. &#8220;Oh,
Bob and Jake and Jasper sowed on less backsetting,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and they&#8217;re buying new teams and plows. Can&#8217;t
you do what they do, though I guess they don&#8217;t go off
for weeks to Winnipeg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man was silent. He had an incentive for hard
work about which she was ignorant, and he had certainly
done much, but the long, iron winter, when there was
nothing that could be done, had proved too severe a test
for him. It was very dreary sitting alone evening after
evening beside the stove, and the company of the somnolent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Sproatly was not cheerful. Now and then his pleasure-loving
nature had revolted from the barrenness of his
lot when, stiff and cold, he drove home from an odd visit
to a neighbor, and arriving in the dark found the stove
had burned out and water had frozen hard inside the
house. These were things his neighbors patiently endured,
but Hawtrey had fled for life and brightness to
Winnipeg.
</p>
<p>Sally glanced up at him with a little nod. &#8220;You take
hold with a good grip. Everybody allows that,&#8221; she observed.
&#8220;The trouble is you let things go afterwards.
You don&#8217;t stay with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Hawtrey. &#8220;I believe you have hit it,
Sally. That&#8217;s very much what&#8217;s the matter with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the girl with quiet insistence, &#8220;won&#8217;t you
try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A faint flush crept into Hawtrey&#8217;s face. Sally was less
than half-taught, and unacquainted with anything beyond
the simple, strenuous life of the prairie. Her greatest
accomplishments consisted of some skill in bakery and
the handling of half-broken teams; but she had once or
twice given him what he recognized as excellent advice.
There was something incongruous in the situation, but, as
usual, he preferred to regard it whimsically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to, if you insist. If ever I&#8217;m the
grasping owner of the biggest farm in this district I&#8217;ll
blame you,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>Sally said nothing further on that subject, and some
time later the sleigh went skimming down among the
birches in a shallow ravine. Hawtrey pulled the horses
up when they reached the bottom of the ravine, and
glanced up at a shapeless cluster of buildings that showed
black amid the trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lorton won&#8217;t be back until to-morrow, but I promised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
to pitch the bags into his granary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I
hump them up the trail here it will save us driving round
through the bluff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got down, and though the bags were heavy, with
Sally&#8217;s assistance he managed to hoist the first of them
on to his shoulders. Then he staggered with it up the
steep foot-trail that climbed the slope. He was more
or less accustomed to carrying bags of grain between
store and wagon, but his mittened hands were numbed,
and his joints were stiff with cold. Sally noticed that
he floundered rather wildly. In another moment or two,
however, he vanished into the gloom among the trees,
and she sat listening to the uneven crunch of his footsteps
in the snow, until there was a sudden crash of
broken branches, and a sound as of something falling
heavily down a declivity. Then there was another crash,
and stillness again.
</p>
<p>Sally gasped, and clenched her mittened hands hard
upon the reins as she remembered that Lorton&#8217;s by-trail
skirted the edge of a very steep bank, but she lost neither
her collectedness nor her nerve. Presence of mind in the
face of an emergency is probably as much a question of
experience as of temperament, and, like other women in
that country, she had seen men struck down by half-trained
horses, crushed by collapsing strawpiles, and once
or twice gashed by mower blades. This was no doubt why
she remembered that the impatient team would probably
move on if she left the sleigh, and therefore drove the
horses to the first of the birches before she got down.
Then she knotted the reins about a branch, and called out
sharply.
</p>
<p>No answer came out of the shadows, and her heart beat
unpleasantly fast as she plunged in among the trees,
keeping below the narrow trail that went slanting up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
side of the declivity, until she stopped, with another gasp,
when she reached a spot where a ray of moonlight filtered
down. A limp figure in an old skin coat lay almost at
her feet, and she dropped on her knees beside it in the
snow. Hawtrey&#8217;s face showed an unpleasant grayish-white
in the faint silvery light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory,&#8221; she cried hoarsely.
</p>
<p>The man opened his eyes, and blinked at her in a half-dazed
manner. &#8220;Fell down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Think I felt
my leg go&mdash;and my side&#8217;s stabbing me. Go for somebody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally glanced round, and noticed that the grain bag
lay burst open not far away. She fancied that he had
clung to it after he lost his footing, which explained why
he had fallen so heavily, but that was not a point of any
consequence now. There was nobody who could help her
within two leagues of the spot, and it was evident that
she could not leave him there to freeze. Then she noticed
that the trees grew rather farther apart just there, and
rising swiftly she ran back to bring the team. The
ascent was steep, and she had to urge the horses, with
sharp cries and blows from her mittened hand, among
shadowy tree trunks and through snapping undergrowth
before she reached the spot where Hawtrey lay. He
looked up at her when at last the horses stood close beside
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t turn them here,&#8221; he told her faintly.
</p>
<p>Sally was never sure how she managed it, for the
sleigh drove against the slender trunks, and the fiery
beasts, terrified by the snapping of the undergrowth,
were almost unmanageable; but at last they were facing
the descent again, and she stooped and twined her
arms about the shoulders of Hawtrey, who now lay almost
against the sleigh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to hurt, Gregory, but I have got to get
you in,&#8221; she warned him.
</p>
<p>Then she gasped, for Hawtrey was a man of full
stature, and it was a heavy lift. She could not raise
him wholly, and he cried out once when his injured leg
trailed in the snow. Still, with the most strenuous effort
she had ever made she moved him a yard or so, and then
staggering fell with her side against the sleigh. She
felt faint with the pain of it, but with another desperate
lift she drew him into the sleigh, and let him sink down
gently upon the bag that still lay there. His eyes had
shut again, and he said nothing now.
</p>
<p>It required only another moment or two to wrap the
thick driving-robe about him, and after that, with one
hand still beneath his neck, she glanced down. It was
clear that he was quite unconscious of her presence, and
stooping swiftly she kissed his gray face. She settled
herself in the driving-seat with only a blanket coat to
shelter her from the cold, and the horses went cautiously
down the slope. She did not urge them until they reached
the level, for the trail that wound up out of the ravine
was difficult, but when the wide white expanse once more
stretched away before them she laid the biting whip
across their backs.
</p>
<p>That was quite sufficient. They were fiery animals,
and when they broke into a furious gallop the rush of
night wind struck her tingling cheeks like a lash of
wires. All power of feeling went out of her hands, her
arms grew stiff and heavy, and she was glad that the
trail led smooth and straight to the horizon. Hawtrey,
who had moved a little, lay helpless across her feet. He
did not answer when she spoke to him.
</p>
<p>The team went far at the gallop. A fine mist of snow
beat against the sleigh, but the girl leaning forward, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
tense figure, with nerveless hands clenched upon the reins,
saw nothing but the blue-gray riband of trail that steadily
unrolled itself before her. At length a blurred mass,
which she knew to be a birch bluff, grew out of the white
waste, and presently a cluster of darker smudges shot
up into the shape of a log-house, sod stables, and straw-pile
granary. A minute or two later, she pulled the team
up with an effort, and a man, who flung the door of the
house open, came out into the moonlight. He stopped,
and gazed at her in astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Creighton!&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand there,&#8221; cried Sally. &#8220;Take the near
horse&#8217;s head, and lead them right up to the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; the man asked stupidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead the team up,&#8221; ordered Sally. &#8220;Jump, if you
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was supposed that Sproatly had never moved with
much expedition in his life, but that night he sprang
towards the horses at a commanding wave of the girl&#8217;s
hand. He started when he saw his comrade lying in the
bottom of the sleigh, but Sally disregarded his hurried
questions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me to get him out,&#8221; she said, when he stopped
the team. &#8220;Keep his right leg as straight as you can. I
don&#8217;t want to lift him. We must slide him in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They did it somehow, though the girl was breathless
before their task was finished, and the perspiration started
from the man. Then Sally turned to Sproatly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get into the sleigh, and don&#8217;t spare the team,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Drive over to Watson&#8217;s, and bring him along.
You can tell him your partner&#8217;s broke his leg, and some
of his ribs. Start right now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly did her bidding, and when the door closed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
behind him she flung off her blanket coat and thrust
plenty of wood into the stove. She looked for some coffee
in the cupboard, and put on a kettle, after which she sat
down on the floor by Hawtrey&#8217;s side. He lay still, with
the thick driving-robe beneath him, and though the color
was creeping back into his face, his eyes were shut, and
he was apparently quite unconscious of her presence. For
the first time she was aware of a distressful faintness,
which, as she had come suddenly out of the stinging frost
into the little overheated room that reeked with tobacco
smoke and a stale smell of cooking, was not astonishing.
She mastered her dizziness, however, and presently, seeing
that Hawtrey did not move, glanced about her with
some curiosity, for it was the first time she had entered
his house.
</p>
<p>The room was scantily furnished, and, though very
few of the bachelor farmers in that country live luxuriously,
she fancied that Sproatly, who had evidently
very rudimentary ideas on the subject of house-cleaning,
had not brought back all the sundries he had thrown out
into the snow. It contained a table, a carpenter&#8217;s bench,
and a couple of chairs. There were still smears of dust
upon the uncovered floor. The birch-log walls had been
rudely paneled half-way up, but the half-seasoned boards
had cracked with the heat, and exuded streaks of resin
to which the grime and dust had clung. A pail, which
contained potato peelings, stood amid a litter of old long-boots
and broken harness against one wall. The floor
was black and thick with grease all round the rusty stove.
A pile of unwashed dishes and cooking utensils stood
upon the table, and the lamp above her head had blackened
the boarded ceiling.
</p>
<p>Sally noticed it all with disgust, and then, seeing that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Hawtrey had opened his eyes, she made a cup of coffee
and persuaded him to drink it. After that he smiled at
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said feebly. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Sproatly? My
side stabs me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally raised one hand. &#8220;You&#8217;re not to say a word,&#8221;
she cautioned. &#8220;Sproatly&#8217;s gone for Watson, and he&#8217;ll
soon fix you up. Now lie quite still, and shut your eyes
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey obeyed her injunction to lie still, but his eyes
were not more than half-closed, and she could not resist the
temptation to see what he would do if she went away.
She had half risen, when he stretched out a hand and felt
for her dress, and she sank down again with a curious
softness in her face. Then he let his eyes close altogether,
as if satisfied, and by and by she gently laid her hand
on his.
</p>
<p>He did not appear to notice it, and, though she did
not know whether he was asleep or unconscious, she sat
beside him, watching him with compassion in her eyes.
There was no sound but the snapping of the birch billets
in the rusty stove. She was anxious, but not unduly so,
for she knew that men who live as the prairie farmers do
usually more or less readily recover from such injuries as
had befallen him. It would not be very long before assistance
arrived, for it was understood that the man for
whom she had sent Sproatly had almost completed a medical
course in an Eastern city before he became a prairie
farmer. Why he had suddenly changed his profession
was a point he did not explain, and, as he had always
shown himself willing to do what he could when any of
his neighbors met with an accident, nobody troubled him
about the matter.
</p>
<p>By and by Sproatly brought Watson to the homestead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
and he was busy with Hawtrey for some time. Then they
got him to bed, and Watson came back to the room where
Sally was anxiously waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hawtrey&#8217;s idea about his injuries is more or less
correct, but we&#8217;ll have no great trouble in pulling him
round,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The one point that&#8217;s worrying me is
the looking after him. One couldn&#8217;t expect him to thrive
upon slabs of burnt salt pork, and Sproatly&#8217;s bread.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can,&#8221; said Sproatly indignantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; replied Watson. &#8220;It would be criminal to
leave you in charge of a sick man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally quietly put on her blanket coat. &#8220;If you can
stay a few hours, I&#8217;ll be back soon after it&#8217;s light,&#8221; she
said. She turned to Sproatly. &#8220;You can wash up those
dishes on the table, and get a brush and sweep this room
out. If it&#8217;s not quite neat to-morrow you&#8217;ll do it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly grinned as she went out. A few moments
later the girl drove away through the bitter frost.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>WYLLARD ASSENTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Sally, who returned with her mother, passed a fortnight
at Hawtrey&#8217;s homestead before Watson decided that his
patient could be entrusted to Sproatly&#8217;s care. Afterwards
she went back twice a week to make sure that Sproatly,
in whom she had no confidence, was discharging his
duties satisfactorily. With baskets of dainties for the invalid
she had driven over one afternoon, when Hawtrey,
whose bones were knitting well, lay talking to another
man in his little sleeping-room.
</p>
<p>There was no furniture in the room except the wooden
bunk in which he lay, and a deerhide lounge chair he had
made. The stove-pipe from the kitchen led across part of
one corner, and then up again into the room beneath the
roof above. It had been one of Sproatly&#8217;s duties since
the accident to rise and renew the fire soon after midnight,
and when Sally arrived he was outside the house, whip-sawing
birch-logs and splitting them, an occupation he
profoundly disliked.
</p>
<p>Spring had come suddenly, as it usually does on the
prairie, and the snow was melting fast under a brilliant
sun. The bright rays that streamed in through the window
struck athwart the glimmering dust motes in the
little bare room, and fell, pleasantly warm, upon the man
who sat in the deerhide chair. He was a year or two
older than Hawtrey, though he had scarcely reached
thirty. He was a man of average height, and somewhat
spare of figure. His manner was tranquil and his lean,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
bronzed face attractive. He held a pipe in his hand, and
was looking at Hawtrey with quiet, contemplative eyes,
that were his most noticeable feature, though it was difficult
to say whether their color was gray or hazel-brown,
for they were singularly clear, and there was something
which suggested steadfastness in their unwavering gaze.
The man wore long boots, trousers of old blue duck, and
a jacket of soft deerskin such as the Blackfeet dress so
expertly; and there was nothing about him to suggest
that he was a man of varied experience, and of some importance
in that country.
</p>
<p>Harry Wyllard was native-born. In his young days
he had assisted his father in the working of a little
Manitoban farm, when the great grain province was still,
for the most part, a wilderness. A prosperous relative on
the Pacific slope had sent him to Toronto University,
where after a session or two he had become involved in a
difference of opinion with the authorities. Though the
matter was never made quite clear, it was generally believed
that Wyllard had quietly borne the blame of a
comrade&#8217;s action, for there was a vein of eccentric generosity
in the lad. In any case, he left Toronto, and the
relative, who was largely interested in the fur business,
next sent him north to the Behring Sea. The business
was then a hazardous one, for the skin buyers and pelagic
sealers had trouble with the Alaskan representatives of
American trading companies, upon whose preserves they
poached, as well as with the commanders of the gunboats
sent up north to protect the seals.
</p>
<p>Men&#8217;s lives were staked against the value of a fur,
edicts were lightly contravened, and now and then a
schooner barely escaped into the smothering fog with
skins looted on forbidden beaches. It was a perilous life,
and a strenuous one, for every white man&#8217;s hand was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
against the traders; there were rangers in fog and gale,
and the reefs that lay in the tideways of almost uncharted
waters; but Wyllard made the most of his chance.
He kept the peace with jealous skippers who resented the
presence of a man they might command as mate, but
whose views they were forced to listen to when he spoke
as supercargo. He won the good-will of sea-bred Indians,
and drove a good trade with them; he not infrequently
brought his boat loaded with reeking skins back
first to the plunging schooner.
</p>
<p>He fell into trouble again when they were hanging off
the Eastern Isles under double reefs, watching for the
Russians&#8217; seals. A boat&#8217;s crew from another schooner
had been cast ashore, and, as the men were in peril of
falling into the Russians&#8217; hands, Wyllard led a reckless
expedition to rescue them. He succeeded, in so far that
the wrecked sailors were taken off the beach through a
tumult of breaking surf; but as the relief crews pulled
seaward the fog shut down on them, and one boat, manned
by three men, never reached the schooners. The vessels
blew horns all night, and crept along the smoking beach
next day, though the surf made landing impossible. Then
a sudden gale drove them off the shore, and, as it was
evident that their comrades must have perished, they
reluctantly sailed for other fishing grounds. As one result
of this, Wyllard broke with his prosperous relative
when he went back to Vancouver.
</p>
<p>After that he helped to strengthen railroad bridges
among the mountains of British Columbia. He worked
in logging camps, and shoveled in the mines, and, as it
happened, met Hawtrey, who, tempted by high wages,
had spent a winter in the Mountain Province. Wyllard&#8217;s
father, who had taken up virgin soil in Assiniboia, died
soon after Wyllard went back to him, and a few months
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
later the relative in Vancouver also died. Somewhat
to Wyllard&#8217;s astonishment, his kinsman bequeathed him
a considerable property, most of the proceeds of which
he sank in acres of virgin prairie. Willow Range was
now one of the largest farms between Winnipeg and the
Rockies.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The leg&#8217;s getting along satisfactorily?&#8221; Wyllard inquired
at length.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey, who appeared unusually thoughtful, admitted
that it was.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s singularly unfortunate that I&#8217;m disabled
just now,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There&#8217;s the plowing to begin
in a week or two, and besides that I was thinking
of getting married.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard was somewhat astonished at this announcement.
For one thing, he was more or less acquainted
with the state of his friend&#8217;s finances. During the next
moment or two he glanced meditatively through the
open door into the adjoining room, where Sally Creighton
was busy beside the stove. The sleeves of the girl&#8217;s
light bodice were rolled up well above the elbow, and she
had pretty, round arms, which were just then partly immersed
in dough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a nicer or more capable girl
in this part of Assiniboia,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; agreed Hawtrey. &#8220;Anybody would admit
that. Still, since you seem so sure of it, why don&#8217;t you
marry her yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard looked at his comrade curiously. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;there are several reasons that don&#8217;t affect Miss
Sally and only concern myself. Besides, it&#8217;s highly improbable
that she&#8217;d have me.&#8221; Before he looked up again
he paused to light his pipe, which had gone out. &#8220;Since
it evidently isn&#8217;t Sally, have I met the lady?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t. She&#8217;s in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s four years, isn&#8217;t it, since you were over there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey lay silent a minute, and then made a little
confidential gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better tell you all about the thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our
folks were people of some little standing in the county.
In fact, as they were far from rich, they had just standing
enough to embarrass them. In most respects, they
were ultra-conventional with old-fashioned ideas, and,
though there was no open break, I&#8217;m afraid I didn&#8217;t get
on with them quite as well as I should have done, which
is why I came out to Canada. They started me on the
land decently, and twice when we&#8217;d harvested frost and
horse-sickness, they sent along the draft I asked them
for. That is one reason why I&#8217;m not going to worry them,
though I&#8217;d very much like another now. You see, there
are two girls, as well as Reggie, who&#8217;s reading for the
Bar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have mentioned the lady yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a connection of some friends of ours. Her
mother, so far as I understand it, married beneath her&mdash;a
man her family didn&#8217;t like. The father and mother
died, and Agatha, who was brought up by the father&#8217;s
relations, was often at the Grange, a little, old-fashioned,
half-ruinous place, a mile or two from where we live
in the North of England. The Grange belongs to her
mother&#8217;s folks, but I think there was still a feud between
them and her father&#8217;s people, who had her trained to
earn her living. We saw a good deal of each other, and
fell in love, as boy and girl will. Well, when I went
back, one winter, after I&#8217;d been here two years, Agatha
was at the Grange again, and we decided then that I
was to bring her out as soon as I had a home to offer
her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>Hawtrey broke off for a moment, and there was a
trace of embarrassment in his manner when he went
on again. &#8220;Perhaps I ought to have managed it
sooner,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Still, things never seem to go quite
as one would like with me, and you can understand that
a dainty, delicate girl reared in comfort in England would
find it rough out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard glanced round the bare room in which he sat,
and into the other, which was also furnished in a remarkably
primitive manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he assented, &#8220;I can quite realize that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hawtrey, &#8220;it&#8217;s a thing that has been
worrying me a good deal of late, because, as a matter
of fact, I&#8217;m not much farther forward than I was
four years ago. In the meanwhile, Agatha, who has some
talent for music, was in a first-class master&#8217;s hands. Afterwards
she gave lessons, and got odd singing engagements.
A week ago, I had a letter from her in which she
said that her throat was giving out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped again for a moment, with trouble in his
face, and then fumbling under his pillow produced a letter,
which he carefully folded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re rather good friends,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;You can
read that part of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard took the letter, and a suggestion of quickening
interest crept into his eyes as he read. Then he looked up
at Hawtrey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a brave letter&mdash;the kind a brave girl would write,&#8221;
he commented. &#8220;Still, it&#8217;s evident that she&#8217;s anxious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment or two there was silence, which was
broken only by Sally clattering about the stove.
</p>
<p>Dissimilar in character, as they were, the two men were
firm friends, and there had been a day when, as they
worked upon a dizzy railroad trestle, Hawtrey had held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Wyllard fast when a plank slipped away. He had thought
nothing of the matter, but Wyllard was one who remembered
things of that kind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Hawtrey, after a long pause, &#8220;you see
my trouble. This place isn&#8217;t fit for her, and I couldn&#8217;t
even go across for some time yet. But her father&#8217;s folks
have died off, and there&#8217;s nothing to be expected from her
mother&#8217;s relatives. Any way, she can&#8217;t be left to face
the blow alone. It&#8217;s unthinkable. Well, there&#8217;s only one
course open to me, and that&#8217;s to raise as much money on
a mortgage as I can, fit the place out with fixings brought
from Winnipeg, and sow a double acreage with borrowed
capital. I&#8217;ll send for her as soon as I can get the house
made a little more comfortable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard sat silent a moment or two, and then leaned
forward in his chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he objected, &#8220;there are two other and wiser
courses. Tell the girl what things are like here, and just
how you stand. She&#8217;d face it bravely. There&#8217;s no doubt
of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey looked at him sharply. &#8220;I believe she would,
but considering that you have never seen her, I don&#8217;t quite
know why you should be sure of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;The girl who wrote that letter
wouldn&#8217;t flinch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hawtrey, &#8220;you can mention the second
course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you have $1,000 at bank interest&mdash;which is
less than any land-broker would charge you&mdash;without a
mortgage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Hawtrey showed a certain embarrassment. &#8220;No,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it can&#8217;t be done. I had a kind
of claim upon my people, though it must be admitted
that I&#8217;ve worked it off, but I can&#8217;t quite bring myself
to borrow money from my friends.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>Wyllard who saw that he meant it, made a gesture of
resignation. &#8220;Then you must let the girl make the most
of it, but keep out of the hands of the mortgage man.
By the way, I haven&#8217;t told you that I&#8217;ve decided to make
a trip to the Old Country. We had a bonanza crop last
season, and Martial could run the range for a month or
two. After all, my father was born yonder, and I can&#8217;t
help feeling now and then that I should have made an
effort to trace up that young Englishman&#8217;s relatives, and
tell them what became of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The one you struck in British Columbia? You have
mentioned him, but, so far as I remember, you never
gave me any particulars about the thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard seemed to hesitate, which was not a habit of
his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not much to tell. I struck the
lad sitting down, played out, upon a trail that led over
a big divide. It was clear that he couldn&#8217;t get any further,
and there wasn&#8217;t a settlement within a good many leagues
of the spot. We were up in the ranges prospecting then.
Well, we made camp and gave him supper&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t
eat very much&mdash;and afterwards he told me what brought
him there. It seemed to me he had always been weedy
in the chest, but he had been working waist-deep in an
icy creek, building a dam at a mine, until his lungs had
given out. The mining boss was a hard case and had no
mercy on him, but the lad, who had had a rough time in
the Mountain Province, stayed with it until he played out
altogether.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s face hardened as he mentioned the mining
boss, and a curious little sparkle crept into his eyes, but
after a pause he proceeded quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;We did what we could for the boy. In fact, it rather
broke up the prospecting trip, but he was too far gone.
He hung for a week or two, and one of us brought a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
doctor out from the settlements, but the day before we
broke camp Jake and I buried him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey made a sign of comprehension. He was reasonably
well acquainted with his comrade&#8217;s character, and
fancied he knew who had brought the doctor out. He
knew also that Wyllard had been earning his living as a
railroad navvy or chopper then, and, in view of the cost
of provisions brought by pack-horse into the remoter bush,
the reason why he had abandoned his prospecting trip
after spending a week or two taking care of the sick lad
was clear enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You never learned his name?&#8221; Hawtrey asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Wyllard. &#8220;I went back to the
mine, but several things suggested that the name upon
the pay-roll wasn&#8217;t his real one. He began a broken message
the night he died, but the hemorrhage cut him off
in the middle of it. The wish that I should tell his
people somehow was in his eyes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard broke off for a moment with the deprecatory
gesture, which in connection with the story was very
expressive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never done it, but how could I? All I know
is that he was a delicately brought up young Englishman,
and the only clew I have is a watch with a London maker&#8217;s
name on it and a girl&#8217;s photograph. I&#8217;ve a very curious
notion that I shall meet that girl some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey, who made no comment, lay still for a minute
or two, but his face suggested that he was considering
something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; he said presently, &#8220;I shall not be fit for a
journey for quite a while yet, and if I went over to England
I couldn&#8217;t get the plowing done and the crop in;
which, if I&#8217;m going to be married, is absolutely necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no doubt about the truth of the statement,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
for the small Western farmer has very seldom a balance
in hand, and for that matter, is not infrequently in debt
to the nearest storekeeper. He must, as a rule, secure a
harvest or abandon his holding, since as soon as the crop
is thrashed the bills pour in. Wyllard made a sign of
assent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Hawtrey went on, &#8220;if you&#8217;re going to England
you could go as my deputy. You could make Agatha
understand what things are like here, and bring her out
to me. I&#8217;ll arrange for the wedding to be soon as she
arrives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard was not a conventional person, but he pointed
out several objections. Hawtrey overruled them, however,
and eventually Wyllard reluctantly assented.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it happens, Mrs. Hastings is going over, too, and
if she comes back about the same time the thing might
be managed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe she&#8217;s in Winnipeg just
now, but I&#8217;ll write to her. By the way, have you a photograph
of Agatha?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; Hawtrey answered. &#8220;She gave me one,
but somehow it got mislaid on house-cleaning. That&#8217;s
rather an admission, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It occurred to Wyllard that it certainly was. In fact,
it struck him as a very curious thing that Hawtrey should
have lost the picture which the girl with whom he was
in love had given him. He sat silent for a moment or
two, and then stood up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I hear from Mrs. Hastings, I&#8217;ll drive around
again. Candidly, the thing has somewhat astonished me.
I always had a fancy it would be Sally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed. &#8220;Sally?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;We&#8217;re first-rate
friends, but I never had the faintest notion of marrying
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard went out to harness his team, and he did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
notice that Sally, who had approached the door with a
tray in her hands a moment or two earlier, drew back
before him softly. When he had crossed the room she
set down the tray and, with her cheeks burning, leaned
upon the table. Then, feeling that she could not stay
in the stove-heated room, she went out, and stood in the
slushy snow. One of her hands was tightly closed, and
all the color had vanished from her cheeks. However,
she contrived to give Hawtrey his supper by and by, and
soon afterwards drove away.

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A CRISIS</h3>
</div>

<p>While Wyllard made arrangements for his journey, and
Sally Creighton went very quietly about her work on the
lonely prairie farm, it happened one evening that Miss
Winifred Rawlinson sat uneasily expectant far back under
the gallery of a concert-hall in an English manufacturing
town. In her back seat Miss Rawlinson could not hear
very well, but it was the cheapest place she could obtain,
and economy was of some little importance to her. Besides,
by craning her neck a little to avoid the hat of the
strikingly dressed young woman in front of her, she could,
at least, see the stage. The programme which she held
in one hand announced that Miss Agatha Ismay would
sing a certain aria from a great composer&#8217;s oratorio. Miss
Rawlinson leaned further forward in her chair when a
girl of about her own age, which was twenty-four, slowly
advanced to the center of the stage.
</p>
<p>The girl on the stage was a tall, well-made, brown-haired
girl, with a quiet grace of movement and a comely
face. She was attired in a long trailing dress of a shimmering
corn-straw tint. Agatha Ismay had sung at unimportant
concerts with marked success, but that evening
there was something very like shrinking in her eyes.
</p>
<p>A crash of chords from the piano melted into a rippling
prelude, and Winifred breathed easier when her friend began
to sing. The voice was sweet and excellently trained,
and there was a deep stillness of appreciation when the
clear notes thrilled through the closely-packed hall. No
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
one could doubt that the first part of the aria was a success,
for half-subdued applause broke out when the voice
sank into silence, and for a few moments the piano rippled
on alone; but it seemed to Winifred that there was
a look of tension in the singer&#8217;s face, and she grew uneasy,
for she understood the cause for it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The last bit of the second part&#8217;s rather trying,&#8221; remarked
a young man behind her. &#8220;There&#8217;s an awkward
jump at two full tones that was too much for our soprano
when we tried it at the choral union. Miss Ismay&#8217;s voice
is very true in intonation, but I don&#8217;t suppose most of
the audience would notice it if she shirked a little and left
that high sharp out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred had little knowledge of music, but she was
sufficiently acquainted with her friend&#8217;s character to be
certain that Agatha would not attempt to leave out the
sharp in question. This was one reason why she sat rigidly
still when the clear voice rang out again. It rose from
note to note, full and even, but she could see the singer&#8217;s
face, and there was no doubt whatever that Agatha was
making a strenuous effort. Nobody else, however, seemed
to notice it, for Winifred flung a swift glance around, and
then fixed her eyes upon the dominant figure in the corn-straw
dress. The sweet voice was still rising and the interested
listener hoped that the accompanist would force
the tone to cover it a little, and put on the loud pedal.
The pianist, however, was gazing at his music, and played
on until, with startling suddenness, the climax came.
</p>
<p>The voice sank a full tone, rose, and hoarsely trailed off
into silence again. Then the accompanist glanced over
his shoulder, and struck a ringing chord while he waited
for a sign. There was a curious stirring in the audience.
The girl in the shimmering dress stood quite still for a
moment with a spot of crimson in her cheek and a half-dazed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
look in her eyes. Then, turning swiftly, she moved
off the stage.
</p>
<p>Winifred rose with a gasp, and turned upon the young
man next her, who looked up inquiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said sharply; &#8220;can&#8217;t you let me pass? I&#8217;m
going out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was about half-past nine when she reached the wet
street. A fine rain drove into her face, and she had rather
more than a mile to walk without an escort, but that was
a matter which caused her no concern. She was a self-reliant
young woman, and accustomed to going about
unattended. She was quite aware that the scene she had
just witnessed would bring about a crisis in her own and
her friend&#8217;s affairs. For all that, she was unpleasantly
conscious of the leak in one shabby boot when she stepped
down from the sidewalk to cross the street, and when
she opened her umbrella beneath a gas lamp she pursed
up her mouth. There were holes in the umbrella near
where the ribs ran into the ferrule; she had not noticed
them before. She, however, resolutely plodded on through
the drizzle, until three young fellows who came with
linked arms down the pavement of a quieter street barred
her way. One wore his hat on one side, the one nearest
the curb flourished a little cane, and the third smiled
at her fatuously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my!&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;Where&#8217;s dear Jemima off to
in such a hurry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred drew herself up. She was little and determined,
and, it must be admitted, not quite unaccustomed
to that kind of thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you let me pass?&#8221; she asked angrily. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a policeman at the next turning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There really is,&#8221; said one of the youths. &#8220;The Dook
has another engagement. Dream of me, Olivia!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>A beat of heavy feet drew nearer, and the three roysterers
disappeared in the direction of a flaming music-hall,
where the second &#8220;house&#8221; was probably beginning.
Winifred, who had stepped into the gutter to avoid the
roysterer with the cane, turned as a stalwart, blue-coated
figure moved towards her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, officer,&#8221; she said, &#8220;they&#8217;ve gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The policeman merely raised a hand as if in comprehension,
and plodded back to his post. Winifred went
on until she let herself into a house in a quiet street, and
ascending to the second floor entered a simply furnished
room, which, however, contained a piano, and a table on
which a typewriter stood amid a litter of papers. The
girl took off her water-proof and sat down in a low chair
beside the little fire. She was not a handsome girl, and
it was evident that she did not trouble herself greatly
about her attire. Her face was too thin and her figure
too slight and spare, but there was usually, even when she
was anxious, as she certainly was that night, a shrewdly
whimsical twinkle in her eyes, and though her lips were
set, her expression was compassionate.
</p>
<p>She was not the person to sit still very long, and in a
minute or two she rose to place a little kettle on the fire.
She took a few scones, a coffee-pot, and a tin of condensed
milk from a cupboard. When she had spread
them out upon a table she discovered that there was some
of the condensed milk upon her fingers, and it must be
admitted that she sucked them. They were little, stubby
fingers, which somehow looked capable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been four o&#8217;clock when I had that bun
and a cup of tea,&#8221; she remarked, half aloud.
</p>
<p>She glanced at the table longingly, for she occasionally
found it necessary to place a certain check upon a
healthy appetite. The practice of such self-denial is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
unfortunately, not a very unusual thing in the case
of many young women who work hard in the great
cities.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must wait for Agatha,&#8221; she said, with a resolute
shake of the head. Crossing the room toward the typewriter
table she stopped to glance at a little framed photograph
that stood upon the mantel. It was a portrait of
Gregory Hawtrey taken years before, and she apostrophized
it with quiet scorn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re wanted you&#8217;re naturally away out yonder,&#8221;
she declared accusingly. &#8220;You&#8217;re like the rest of
them&mdash;despicable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This seemed to relieve her feelings, and she sat down
before the typewriter, which clicked and rattled for several
minutes under her stubby fingers. The clicking
ceased with sudden abruptness, and she prodded the carriage
of the machine viciously with a hairpin. As this
appeared unavailing, she used her forefinger, and when
at length it slid along the rod with a clash there was
a smear of grimy oil upon her cheek and her nose. The
machine gave no further trouble, and she endeavored
to make up some of the time that she had spent at the
concert. It was necessary that it should be made up, but
she was conscious that she was putting off an evil moment.
</p>
<p>At last the door opened, and Agatha Ismay, wrapped
in a long cloak, came in. She permitted Winifred to
take her wrap from her, and then sank down into a chair.
There was a strained look in her eyes, and her face was
very weary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re working late again,&#8221; she observed.
</p>
<p>Winifred nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the men who loaf, my dear,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;When you undertake the transcription of
an author&#8217;s scrawl at ninepence the thousand words you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
have to work hard, especially when, as it is in this case,
the thing&#8217;s practically unreadable. Besides, the woman in
it makes me lose my temper. If I&#8217;d had a man of the kind
described to deal with I&#8217;d have thrashed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was talking at random, partly to conceal her
anxiety, and partly with the charitable purpose of giving
her companion time to approach the subject that must
be mentioned; but she rather overdid her effort to appear
at ease. Agatha looked at her sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Winny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you know. You&#8217;ve been there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred turned towards her quietly, for she could face
a crisis.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she confessed, &#8220;I have, but you&#8217;re not going
to talk about it until you have had supper. Don&#8217;t move
until I make the coffee.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was genuinely hungry, but while she satisfied her
own appetite she took care that her companion, who did
not seem inclined to eat, made a simple meal. Then she
put the plates into a cupboard and sat down facing
Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have broken down exactly as
that throat specialist said you would. The first question
is, how long it will be before you can go on again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha laughed, a little harsh laugh. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell
you everything at the time: I&#8217;ve broken down for good,&#8221;
she answered.
</p>
<p>There was a moment of tense silence, and then Agatha
made a dejected gesture. &#8220;The specialist warned me that
this might happen if I went on singing, but what could
I do? I couldn&#8217;t cancel my engagements without telling
people why. The physician said I must go to Norway and
give my throat and chest a rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and there was in their eyes
the half-bitter, half-weary smile of those to whom the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
cure prescribed is ludicrously impossible. It was Winifred
who spoke first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she commented, &#8220;we have to face the situation,
and it&#8217;s not an encouraging one. Our joint earnings
just keep us here in decency&mdash;we won&#8217;t say comfort&mdash;and
they&#8217;re evidently to be subject to a big reduction.
It strikes me as a rather curious coincidence that a letter
from that man in Canada and one from your prosperous
friends in the country arrived just before you went out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw the look in Agatha&#8217;s eyes, and spread her hands
out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she admitted; &#8220;I hid them. It seemed to
me that you had quite enough upon your mind this evening.
I don&#8217;t know whether the letters are likely to throw
any fresh light upon the question what we&#8217;re going to
do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She produced the letters from a drawer in her table,
and Agatha straightened herself suddenly in her chair
when she had opened the first of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;he wants me to go out to him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred&#8217;s face set hard for a moment, but it relaxed
again, and she contrived to hide her dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she suggested, &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll certainly
go. After all, he&#8217;s probably not worse to live with than
most of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Rawlinson was occasionally a little bitter, but,
like others of her kind, she had been compelled to compete
in an overcrowded market with hard-driven men. She
was, however, sincerely attached to her friend, and she
smiled when she saw the flash in Agatha&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t try to wither me with
your indignation. No doubt he&#8217;s precisely what he ought
to be, and I dare say it will ease your feelings if you
talk about him again; at least it will help you to formulate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
your reasons for going out to him. I&#8217;ll listen patiently,
and try not to be uncharitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha fell in with the suggestion. It was a relief to
talk, and she had a certain respect, which she would not
always admit, for her friend&#8217;s shrewdness. She meant to
go, but she desired to ascertain how a less interested person
would regard the course that she had decided on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known Gregory since I was a girl,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Winifred pursed up her lips. &#8220;I understood you met
him at the Grange, and you were only there for a few
weeks once a year,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;After all, that isn&#8217;t a
very great deal. It seems he fell in love with you, which
is, perhaps, comprehensible. What I don&#8217;t quite know
the reason for is why you fell in love with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; responded Agatha, &#8220;you have never seen Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; admitted Winifred sourly; &#8220;I have, however,
seen his picture. One must admit that he&#8217;s reasonably
good-looking. In fact, I&#8217;ve seen quite an assortment
of photographs, but it&#8217;s, perhaps, significant that
the last was taken some years ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled. &#8220;Can a photograph show the clean,
sanguine temperament of a man, his impulsive generosity,
and cheerful optimism?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Rawlinson rose, and critically surveyed the photograph
on the mantel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be discouraging, but after studying
that one I&#8217;m compelled to admit that it can&#8217;t. No doubt
it&#8217;s the artist&#8217;s fault, but I&#8217;m willing to admit that a
young girl would be rather apt to credit a man with a
face like that with qualities he didn&#8217;t possess.&#8221; She sat
down again with a thoughtful expression. &#8220;The fact is,
you set him up on a pedestal and burned incense to him
when you were not old enough to know any better, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
when he came home for a few weeks four years ago you
promised to marry him. Now it seems he&#8217;s ready at last,
and wants you to go out to the new country. Perhaps it
doesn&#8217;t affect the question, but if I&#8217;d promised to marry
a man in Canada he&#8217;d certainly have to come for me. Isn&#8217;t
there a certain risk in the thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A risk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;rather a serious
one. Four years is a long time, and the man may have
changed. In a new country where life is so different,
it must be a thing they&#8217;re rather apt to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A faint, half-compassionate, half-tolerant smile crept
into Agatha&#8217;s eyes. The mere idea that the sunny-tempered,
brilliant young man to whom she had given her
heart could have changed or degenerated in any way
seemed absurd to her. Winifred, however, went on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another point,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If he&#8217;s still the
same, which isn&#8217;t likely, there has certainly been a change
in you. You have learned to see things more clearly, and
have acquired a different standard from the one you had
then. One can&#8217;t help growing, and as one grows one
looks for more. One is no longer pleased with the same
things; it&#8217;s inevitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She broke off for a moment, and her voice became
gentler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I&#8217;ve done my duty in trying to
point this out to you, and now there&#8217;s only another thing
to say: since you&#8217;re clearly bent on going, I&#8217;m going with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked astonished, but there was a suggestion
of relief in her expression, for the two had been firm
friends and had faced a good deal together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;that gets over the one difficulty!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Winifred made a little whimsical gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure that it does. The difficulty will
probably be when I arrive in Canada, but I&#8217;m a rather
capable person, and I believe they don&#8217;t pay ninepence
a thousand words in Winnipeg. Besides, I could keep
the books at a store or a hotel, and at the very worst Gregory
could, perhaps, find a husband for me. Women, I
hear, are held in some estimation in that country. Perhaps
there&#8217;s a man out there who would treat decently
even a little, plain, vixenish-tempered person with a
turned-up nose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crossing the room again she banged the cover down
on the typewriter, and then turned to Agatha with a
suggestion of haziness in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m very tired of this country. It would
be intolerable when you went away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha stretched out a hand and drew the girl down
beside her. She no longer feared adverse fortune and
loneliness, and she was filled with a gentle compassion, for
she knew how hard a fight Winifred had made, and part
at least of what she had borne.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we will go together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she opened the second letter, which she had forgotten
while they talked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They want me to stay at the Grange for a few weeks,&#8221;
she announced, and smiled. &#8220;An hour ago I felt crushed
and beaten&mdash;and now, though my voice has probably gone
for good, I don&#8217;t seem to mind. Isn&#8217;t it curious that both
these letters should have come to sweep my troubles away
to-night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Winifred, &#8220;it&#8217;s distinctly natural&mdash;just
what one would have expected. You wrote to the man
in Canada soon after you&#8217;d seen the specialist, and his
answer was bound to arrive in the next few days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I certainly didn&#8217;t write the folks at the Grange.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;As it happens, I did, two
days ago. I ventured to point out their duty to them,
and they were rather nice about it in another letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a little sigh of contentment Agatha stretched herself
out in the low chair. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it probably
wouldn&#8217;t have the least effect if I scolded you. I
believe I&#8217;m horribly worn out, Winny, and it will be a
relief unspeakable to get away. If I can arrange to give
up those pupils I&#8217;ll go to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred made no answer. Kneeling with one elbow
resting on the arm of Agatha&#8217;s chair, she gazed straight in
front of her. Both of the girls were very weary of the
long, grim struggle, and now a change was close at hand.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE OLD COUNTRY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a still, clear evening of spring when Wyllard, unstrapping
the rücksack from his shoulders, sat down beside
a frothing stream in a dale of Northern England.
On his arrival in London a week or two earlier he had
found awaiting him a letter from Mrs. Hastings, who
was then in Paris, in which she said that she could not at
the moment say when she would go home again, but that
she expected to advise him shortly.
</p>
<p>After answering the letter Wyllard started North, and,
obtaining Agatha&#8217;s address from Miss Rawlinson, went
on again to a certain little town, which, encircled by towering
fells, stands beside a lake in the North Country.
He had already recognized that his mission was rather a
delicate one, and he decided that it would be advisable
to wait until he heard from Mrs. Hastings before calling
upon Miss Ismay. There remained the question, what to
do with the next few days. A conversation with several
pedestrian tourists whom he met at his hotel, and a glance
at a map of the hill-tracks decided him. Remembering
that he had on several occasions kept the trail in Canada
for close on forty miles, he bought a Swiss pattern rücksack,
and set out on foot through the fells.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, he saw scenery that gave him a new conception
of the Old Country. He astonished his new friends,
the tourists, who volunteered to show him the way over
what they considered a difficult pass. To their great astonishment
the brown-faced stranger, who wore ordinary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
tight-fitting American attire and rather pointed American
shoes, went up the mountainside apparently without
an effort, and for the credit of the clubs to which they belonged
it was incumbent on them to keep pace with him.
They did not know that he had carried bags of flour and
mining tools over very much higher passes, close up to
the limit of eternal snow, but they did know that he set
them a difficult pace, and after two days&#8217; climbing they
were relieved to part company with him.
</p>
<p>A professional guide who overtook them recognized the
capabilities of the man when he noticed the way in which
he lifted his feet and how he set them down. This, the
guide decided, was a man accustomed to walking among
the heather, but he was wrong; for it was the trick the
bushman learns when he plods through leagues of undergrowth
and fallen branches, or the tall grass of the swamps;
and it is a memorable experience to make a day&#8217;s journey
with such a man. For the first hour the thing seems
easy, as the pace is never forced, but the speed never slackens;
and as the hours go by the novice, who flounders
and stumbles, grows horribly weary of trying to keep up
with the steady, persistent swing.
</p>
<p>Wyllard had traveled since morning along a ridge of
fells when he sat down beside the water and contentedly
filled his pipe. On the one hand, a wall of crags high
above was growing black against the evening light, and
the stream, clear as crystal, came boiling down among
great boulders. But the young man had wandered through
many a grander and more savage scene of rocky desolation,
and it impressed him less than the green valley in
front of him. He had never seen anything like that
either on the Pacific slope or in Western Canada.
</p>
<p>Early as it was in the season, the meadows between
rock and water were green as emerald, and the hedge-rows,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
just flushed with verdure, were clipped and trimmed
as if their owner loved them. There was not a dead tree
in the larch copse which dipped to the stream, and all its
feathery tassels were sprinkled with tiny flecks of crimson
and wondrous green. Great oaks dotted the meadows,
each one perfect in symmetry. It seemed that the men
who held this land cared for single trees. The sleek,
tame cattle that rubbed their necks on the level hedge-top
and gazed at him ruminatively were very different
from the wild, long-horned creatures whose furious stampede
he had now and then headed off, riding hard while
the roar of hoofs rang through the dust-cloud that floated
like a sea fog across the sun-scorched prairie. Here, in
the quiet vale, all was peace and tranquillity.
</p>
<p>Wyllard noticed the pale primroses that pushed their
yellow flowers up among the withered leaves, and he took
account of the faint blue sheen beneath the beech trunks
not far away. There was a vein of artistic feeling in
him, and the elusive beauty of these things curiously
appealed to him. He had seen the riotous, sensuous blaze
of flowers kissed by Pacific breezes, and the burnished
gold of wheat that rolled in mile-long waves; but it seemed
to him that the wild things of the English North were,
after all, more wonderful. They harmonized with the
country&#8217;s deep peacefulness; their beauty was chaste, fairy-like
and ethereal.
</p>
<p>By and by a wood pigeon cooed softly somewhere in
the shadows, and a brown thrush perched on a bare oak
bough began to sing. The broken, repeated melody went
curiously well with the rippling murmur of sliding water,
and Wyllard, though he could not remember ever having
done anything of that sort before, leaned back with a
smile to listen. His life had been a strenuous one, passed
for the most part in the driving-seat of great plows that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
rent their ample furrows through virgin prairie, guiding
the clinking binders through the wheat under a blazing
sun, or driving the plunging dories through the
clammy fog over short, slopping seas. Now, however, the
tranquillity of the English valley stole in on him, and he
began to understand how the love of that well-trimmed
land clung to the men out West, who spoke of it tenderly
as the &#8220;Old Country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, for he was in an unusually susceptible mood, he
took from his pocket a little deerhide case, artistically
made by a Blackfoot Indian, and removed from it the
faded photograph of an English girl. He had obtained
the photograph from the lad who had died among the
ranges of the Pacific slope, and it had been his companion
in many a desolate camp and on many a weary journey.
The face was delicately modeled, and there was a freshness
in it which is seldom seen outside the Old Country;
but what pleased him most was the serenity in the clear,
innocent eyes.
</p>
<p>He was not in love with the picture&mdash;he would probably
have smiled at the notion&mdash;but he had a curious feeling
that he would meet the girl some day, and that it would
then be a privilege merely to speak to her. This was, after
all, not so extravagant a fancy as it might appear, for
romance, the mother of chivalry and many graces, still
finds shelter in the hearts of men who dwell in the wide
spaces of the newer lands. Shrewd and practical as these
men are, they see visions now and then, and, what is more,
with bleeding hands and toil incredible prove them to
be realities.
</p>
<p>By and by Wyllard put the photograph back into his
pocket, and filled his pipe again. It was almost dark
before he had smoked it out. The thrush had gone, and
only the ripple of the water broke the silence, until he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
heard footsteps on the stones behind him. Looking
around, he saw a young woman moving towards the river.
He watched her with a quiet interest, for his perceptions
were sharper than usual, and it seemed to him that she
was very much in harmony with what he thought of as
the key-tone of the place. She was tall and shapely, and
she moved with grace. When, poised upon a shelf of
rock as if considering the easiest way to the water, she
stopped for a moment, her figure fell into reposeful lines,
but that was after all only what he had expected, for he
had half-consciously studied the Englishwomen whom he
had met in the West.
</p>
<p>The Western women usually moved, and certainly spoke,
with an almost superfluous vivacity and alertness. There
was in them a feverish activity, which contrasted with
the English deliberation, which had sometimes exasperated
him. Now he felt that this slowness of movement
was born of the tranquillity of the well-trimmed land, and
he realized that it would have troubled his sense of fitness
if this girl had clattered down across the stones hurriedly
and noisily.
</p>
<p>At first he could not see her face, but when she went
on a little further it became evident that she desired
to cross the river, and was regarding the row of stepping
stones somewhat dubiously. One or two had fallen over,
or had been washed away by a flood, for there were several
wide gaps between them, through which the stream
frothed whitely. As soon as Wyllard noticed her hesitation,
he rose and moved towards her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to get across?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>She was still glancing at the water, and although he
was sure that she had not seen him or heard his approach,
she turned towards him quietly. Then a momentary sense
of astonishment held him in an embarrassed scrutiny, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
it was her picture at which he had gazed scarcely half
an hour before, and he would have recognized the face
anywhere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It is rather a long way around
by the bridge, but some of the stones seem to have disappeared
since I last came this way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She spoke, as Wyllard had expected, softly and quietly.
Because he was first of all a man of action, Wyllard forthwith
waded into the river. Then he turned and held out
his hand to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a very long step. You ought to manage it,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>The girl favored him with a swift glance of uncertainty.
At first she had supposed him to be one of the
walking tourists or climbers who usually invaded the valleys
at Easter; but they were, for the most part, young
men from the cities, and this stranger&#8217;s face was darkened
by the sun. There was also an indefinite suggestion
of strength in the poise of his lean, symmetrical figure,
which could only have come from strenuous labor in the
open air. She noticed that while the average Englishman
would have asked permission to help her, or would have
deprecated the offer, this stranger did nothing of the kind.
He stood with the water frothing about his ankles, holding
out his hand.
</p>
<p>She had no hesitation about accepting Wyllard&#8217;s aid,
and, while he waded through the river, she stepped lightly
from stone to stone until she came to a wide gap, where
the stream was deep. She stopped a moment, gazing at
the foaming water, until the man&#8217;s hand tightened on her
fingers, and she felt his other hand rest upon her waist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he assured her, &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you fall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was on the other side of the gap in another moment.
Wondering uneasily why she had obeyed the compelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
pressure, but glad to see that the stranger&#8217;s face
was perfectly unmoved, and that he was evidently quite
unconscious of having done anything unusual, she crossed
without mishap. When they stood on the shingle he
dropped her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you got rather
wet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man laughed, and he had a pleasant laugh. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m used to it.&#8221; There was a little silence
and he asked: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a village with a hotel in it,
a mile or two from here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl answered, &#8220;this is the way. The path
goes up to the highroad through the larch wood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned into the path, and, though she had not expected
him to accompany her, the man walked beside her.
Still she did not resent it. His manner was deferential,
and she liked his face, while there was, after all, no reason
why he should stay behind when he was going the same
way. He walked beside her silently for several minutes
as they went on through the gloom of the larches, where
a sweet, resinous odor crept into the still evening air,
and then he looked up as they came to a towering pine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you many of those trees over here?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>A light dawned upon the girl, for, though he had spoken
without a perceptible accent, she had been slightly puzzled
by something in his speech and appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe they&#8217;re not uncommon. You are an American?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I was born in
Western Canada, but I think I&#8217;m as English as you are,
in some respects, though I never quite realized it until
to-night. It isn&#8217;t exactly because my father came from
this country, either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was astonished at this answer, and still more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
at the indefinite something in his manner which seemed
to indicate that he expected her to understand, as, indeed,
she did. Her only dowry had been an expensive education
and she remembered that the influence of the isle
she lived in had in turn fastened on Saxons, Norsemen,
Normans, and made them Englishmen. What was more,
so far as she had read, those who had gone out South or
Westwards had carried that influence with them, and,
under all their surface changes, and sometimes their grievances
against the Motherland, were, in the great essentials,
wholly English still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she remarked at random, &#8220;how can you be sure
that I&#8217;m English?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was quite dark in among the trees, but she fancied
there was a smile in her companion&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he answered simply, &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t be anything
else!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She accepted this as a compliment, though she knew
that it had not been his intention to flatter her. His general
attitude since she had met him scarcely suggested
such, a lack of good taste. She was becoming mildly interested
in the stranger, but she possessed several essentially
English characteristics, and it did not appear advisable
to encourage him too much. She said nothing
further, and it was he who spoke first.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you knew a young lad who
went out to Canada a few years ago. His name was Pattinson&mdash;Henry
Pattinson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the girl answered quickly. &#8220;I certainly did not.
But the name is not an uncommon one. There are a good
many Pattinsons in the North.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard was not surprised by this answer. He had
reasons for believing that the name under which the lad
he had befriended had enrolled himself was not the correct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
one. It would, of course, have been easy to describe
the boy, but Wyllard was shrewd, and noticing that there
was now a restraint in the girl&#8217;s manner he could not
speak prematurely. He was aware that most of the English
are characterized by a certain reserve, and apt to retire
into their shells if pressed too hard. He did not,
however, mean to let this girl elude him altogether.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It really doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;I shall
no doubt get upon his trail in due time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They reached the highroad a minute or two later, and
the girl turned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you again,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you go straight
on you will come to the village in about a quarter of an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned away and left him standing with his soft
hat in his hand. He stood quite still for almost a minute
after she had gone. When he reached the inn its
old-world simplicity delighted him. It was built with
thick walls of slate, and roofed with ponderous flags. In
Canada, where the frost was Arctic, they used thin cedar
shingles. The room in which his meal was spread was
paneled with oak that had turned black with age. Great
rough-hewn beams of four times the size that anybody
would have used for the purpose in the West supported the
low ceiling. There was a fire in the wide hearth and the
ruddy gleam of burnished copper utensils pierced the
shadows. The room was large, but there was only a single
candle upon the table. He liked the gloomy interior, and
he felt that a garish light would somehow be out of harmony.
</p>
<p>By and by his hostess appeared to clear the things away.
She was a little, withered old woman, with shrewd,
kindly eyes, and a russet tinge in her cheeks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good light, and company in the sitting-room,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve three young men staying with
us. They&#8217;ve been up the Pike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d sooner stay here, if I may,&#8221; replied Wyllard.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know yet if I&#8217;ll go on to-morrow. One
can get through to Langley Dale by the Hause, as I think
you call it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wrinkled dame said that pedestrians often went
that way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some prosperous folks&mdash;people of station&mdash;living
round here?&#8221; Wyllard asked casually.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the vicar. I don&#8217;t know that he&#8217;s what you&#8217;d
call prosperous. Then there&#8217;s Mr. Martindale, of Rushyholme,
and Little, of the Ghyll.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has any of them a daughter of about twenty-four
years of age?&#8221; Wyllard described the girl he had met to
the best of his ability.
</p>
<p>It was evident that the landlady did not recognize the
description, but she thought a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;there&#8217;s nobody like that; but I
did hear that they&#8217;d a young lady staying at the vicarage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She changed the subject abruptly, and Wyllard once
more decided that the English did not like questions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a stranger, sir?&#8221; she inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Wyllard. &#8220;I&#8217;ve some business to attend
to further on, but I came along on foot, to see the fells,
and I&#8217;m glad I did. It&#8217;s a great and wonderful country
you&#8217;re living in. That is,&#8221; he added gravely, &#8220;when you
get outside the towns. There are things in some of the
cities that most make one ill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood up. &#8220;That tray&#8217;s too heavy for you. Won&#8217;t
you let me carry it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The landlady was plainly amazed at his words, but she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
made it clear that she desired no assistance. When she
went out Wyllard, who sat down again, took out the
photograph. He gazed at it steadfastly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s rather more than mere prettiness there, but
I don&#8217;t know that I want to keep it now,&#8221; he reflected.
&#8220;It&#8217;s way behind the original. She has grown since it
was taken&mdash;just as one would expect that girl to grow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lighted his pipe and smoked thoughtfully until he
arrived at a decision.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One can&#8217;t force the running in this country. They
don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lie by a day or two, and keep
an eye on that vicarage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile his hostess was discussing him with a
niece.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know what that man is,&#8221; she informed
the younger woman. &#8220;He has got the manners
of a gentleman, but he walks like a fell shepherd, and his
hands are like a navvy&#8217;s. A man&#8217;s hands now and then
tell you a good deal about him. Besides, of all things,
he wanted to carry his tray away. Said it was too heavy
for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; replied her niece, &#8220;he&#8217;s an American. There&#8217;s
no accounting for them.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>HER PICTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Wyllard stayed at the inn three days without seeing
anything more of the girl whom he had met beside the
stream, although he diligently watched for her. He had
long felt it was his duty to communicate with the relatives
of the lad that he had befriended, and the fact that
he had found the girl&#8217;s photograph in the young Englishman&#8217;s
possession made it appear highly probable that she
could assist him in tracing the family. Apart from this,
he could not quite analyze his motives for desiring to see
more of the Englishwoman, though he was conscious of
the desire. Her picture had been a companion to him in
his wanderings, and now and then he had found a certain
solace in gazing at it. Now that he had seen her in the
flesh he was willing to admit that he had never met any
woman who had made such an impression on him.
</p>
<p>It was, of course, possible for him to call at the vicarage,
but though he meant to adopt that course as a last
resort, there were certain objections to it. He did not
know the girl&#8217;s name, and there was nobody to say a word
for him. So far as his experience went, the English
were apt to be reticent and reserved to a stranger. It
seemed to him that, although the girl might give him the
information which he required, their acquaintance probably
would terminate then and there. She would, he decided,
be less likely to stand upon her guard if he could
contrive to meet her casually without prearrangement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>On the fourth day fortune favored him, for he came
upon her endeavoring to open a tottering gate where a
stony hill track led off from the smooth white road. As
it happened, he had received a letter from Mrs. Hastings
that morning, fixing the date of her departure, and it
was necessary for him to discharge the duty with which
Hawtrey had saddled him as soon as possible. The
Grange, where he understood Miss Ismay was then staying,
lay thirty miles away across the fells, and he had
decided to start early on the morrow. That being the
case, it was clear that he must make the most of this
opportunity; but he realized that it would be advisable
to proceed circumspectly. Saying nothing, he set his
shoulder to the gate, and lifting it on its decrepit hinges
swung it open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the girl. Remembering that the
words were the last that she had said to him, she smiled,
as she added: &#8220;It is the second time you have appeared
when I was in difficulties.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of his resolution to proceed cautiously, a
twinkle crept into Wyllard&#8217;s eyes, and suggested that the
fact she had mentioned was not so much of a coincidence
as it probably appeared. She saw the look that told her
what he was thinking, and was about to pass on, when
he stopped her with a gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, I have been looking out for you the last
three days,&#8221; he confessed.
</p>
<p>He feared the girl had taken alarm at this candid statement,
and spread his hands out deprecatingly. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
you hear me out?&#8221; he added. &#8220;There&#8217;s a matter I must
put before you, but I won&#8217;t keep you long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was a little puzzled, and naturally curious.
It struck her as strange that his admission should have
aroused in her very little indignation; but she felt that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
would be unreasonable to suspect this man of anything
that savored of impertinence. His manner was reassuring,
and she liked his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said inquiringly.
</p>
<p>Wyllard waved his hand toward a big oak trunk that
lay just inside the gate.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll sit down, I&#8217;ll get through as quick as I can,&#8221;
he promised. &#8220;In the first place, I am, as I told you,
a Canadian, who has come over partly to see the country,
and partly to carry out one or two missions. In regard to
one of them I believe you can help me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s face expressed a natural astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could help you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll explain my reasons for believing
it later on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the meanwhile, I asked
you a question the other night, which I&#8217;ll now try to make
more explicit. Were you ever acquainted with a young
Englishman, who went to Canada from this country several
years ago? He was about twenty then, and had dark
hair and dark eyes. That, of course, isn&#8217;t an unusual
thing, but there was a rather curious white mark on his
left temple. If he was ever a friend of yours, that scar
ought to fix it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried the girl, &#8220;that must have been Lance
Radcliffe. I was with him when the scar was made&mdash;ever
so long ago. We heard that he was dead. But you said
his name was Pattinson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; declared Wyllard gravely. &#8220;Still, I wasn&#8217;t
quite sure about the name being right. He&#8217;s certainly
dead. I buried him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His companion made an abrupt movement, and he saw
the sudden softening of her eyes. There was, however,
only a gentle pity in her face, and nothing in her manner
suggested the deeper feeling that he had half expected.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am sure that his father would
like to meet you. There was some trouble between them&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know which was wrong&mdash;and Lance went out to
Canada, and never wrote. Major Radcliffe tried to
trace him through a Vancouver banker, and only
found that he had died in the hands of a stranger who
had done all that was possible for him.&#8221; She turned to
Wyllard with a look which set his heart beating faster
than usual. &#8220;You are that man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Wyllard simply, &#8220;I did what I could for
him. It didn&#8217;t amount to very much. He was too far
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Briefly he repeated the story that he had told to Hawtrey,
and, when he had finished, her face was soft again,
for what he said had stirred her curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she commented, &#8220;he had no claim on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard lifted one hand with a motion that disclaimed
all right to commendation. &#8220;He was dying in the bush.
Wasn&#8217;t that enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl made no answer for a moment or two. She
had earned her living for several years, and she was to
some extent acquainted with the grim realities of life.
She did not know that while there are hard men in Canada
the small farmers and ranchers of the West&mdash;and, perhaps
above all, the fearless free lances who build railroads and
grapple with giant trees in the forests of the Pacific slope&mdash;are
as a rule, distinguished by a splendid charity. With
them the sick or worn-out stranger is seldom turned away.
Watching the stranger covertly, she understood that this
man whom she had seen for the first time three days before
had done exactly what she would have expected of
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a great deal of Lance Radcliffe&mdash;when I was
younger,&#8221; she said. &#8220;His people still live at Garside Scar,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
close by Dufton Holme. I presume you will call on
them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard said that he purposed doing so, as he had a
watch and one or two other mementos that they might
like to have, and she told him how to reach Dufton Holme
by a round-about railway journey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one point that rather puzzles me,&#8221; she said,
after she had made it plain how he was to find the Radcliffe
family. &#8220;How did you know that I could tell you
anything about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard thrust his hand into his pocket, and took out
a little leather case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are by no means a stranger to me,&#8221; he remarked
as he handed her the photograph. &#8220;This is your picture;
I found it among the dead lad&#8217;s things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl, who started visibly, flashed a keen glance at
him. It was evident that he had not intended to produce
any dramatic effect. She flushed a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew he had it,&#8221; she asserted. &#8220;Perhaps he
got it from his sister.&#8221; She paused, and then, as if impelled
to make the fact quite clear, added, &#8220;I certainly
never gave it to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled gravely, for he recognized that while
she was clearly grieved to hear of young Radcliffe&#8217;s death,
she could have had no particular tenderness for the unfortunate
lad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;perhaps he took it in the first place
for the mere beauty of it, and it afterwards became a companion&mdash;something
that connected him with the Old
Country. It appealed in one of those ways to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again she flashed a sharp glance at him, but he went
on unheeding:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I found it I meant to keep it merely as a clew,
and so that it could be given up to his relatives some day,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
he added. &#8220;Then I fell into the habit of looking at it in
my lonely camp in the bush at night, and when I sat
beside the stove while the snow lay deep upon the prairie.
There was something in your eyes that seemed to encourage
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To encourage you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Wyllard assented gravely, &#8220;I think that expresses
it. When I camped in the bush of the Pacific
slope we were either out on the gold trail&mdash;and we generally
came back ragged and unsuccessful after spending
several months&#8217; wages which we could badly spare&mdash;or I
was going from one wooden town to another without a
dollar in my pocket and wondering how I was to obtain
one when I got there. For a time it wasn&#8217;t much more
cheerful on the prairie. Twice in succession the harvest
failed. Perhaps Lance Radcliffe felt as I did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl cut him short. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you mention the
photograph at once?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled at her. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
want to be precipitate&mdash;you English folk don&#8217;t seem to like
that. I think&#8221;&mdash;and he seemed to consider&mdash;&#8220;I wanted
to make sure you wouldn&#8217;t be repelled by what might look
like Colonial <i>brusquerie</i>. You see, you have been over
snow-barred divides and through great shadowy forests
with me. We&#8217;ve camped among the boulders by lonely
lakes, and gone down frothing rapids. I felt&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell
you why&mdash;that I was bound to meet you some day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His frankness was startling, but the girl showed neither
astonishment nor resentment. She felt certain that this
stranger was not posing or speaking for effect. It did
not occur to Wyllard that he might have gone too far,
and for a moment or two he leaned against the gate,
while she looked at him with what he thought of as her
gracious English calm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>Pale sunshine fell upon them, though the larches beside
the road were rustling beneath a cold wind, and the song
of the river came up brokenly out of the valley. An
odor of fresh grass floated about them, and the dry, cold
smell of the English spring was in the air. Across the
valley dim ghosts of hills lighted by evanescent gleams rose
out of the east wind grayness with shadowy grandeur.
</p>
<p>Then Wyllard aroused himself. &#8220;I wonder if I ought
to write Major Radcliffe and tell him what my object is
before I call,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would make the thing a little
easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl rose. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented, &#8220;that would, perhaps,
be wiser.&#8221; She glanced at the photograph which
was still in her hand. &#8220;It has served its purpose. I
scarcely think it would be of any great interest to Major
Radcliffe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw his face change as she made it evident that
she did not mean to give the portrait back to him. There
was, at least, one excellent reason why she would not have
her picture in a strange man&#8217;s hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for the story. I am glad
we have met; but I&#8217;m afraid I have already kept my
friends waiting for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned away, and it occurred to Wyllard that
he had made a very indifferent use of the opportunity,
since she had neither asked his name nor told him hers.
It was, however, evident that he could not well run after
her and demand her name, and he decided that he could
in all probability obtain it from Major Radcliffe. Still, he
regretted his lack of adroitness as he walked back to the
inn, where he wrote two letters when he had consulted a
map and his landlady. Dufton Holme, he discovered, was
a small village within a mile or two of the Grange where,
as Miss Rawlinson had informed him, Agatha Ismay was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
then staying. One letter was addressed to her, and he formally
asked permission to call upon her with a message
from George Hawtrey. The other was to Major Radcliffe,
and in both he said that an answer would reach him
at the inn which his landlady had informed him was to be
found not far from both of the houses he intended to
visit.
</p>
<p>He set out on foot next morning, and, after climbing
a steep pass, followed a winding track across a waste of
empty moor until he struck a smooth white road, which
led past a rock-girt lake and into a deep valley. It was
six o&#8217;clock in the morning when he started, and three in
the afternoon when he reached the inn, where he found
an answer to one of the letters awaiting him. It was
from Major Radcliffe, who desired an interview with him
as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>Within an hour he was on his way to the Major&#8217;s
house, where a gray-haired man, whose yellow skin suggested
long exposure to a tropical sun, and a little withered
lady were waiting for him. They received him
graciously, but there was an indefinite something in their
manner and bearing which Wyllard, who had read a great
deal, recognized, though he had never been brought into
actual contact with it until then. He felt that he could
not have expected to come across such people anywhere
but in England, unless it was at the headquarters of a
British battalion in India.
</p>
<p>He told his story tersely, softening unpleasant details
and making little of what he had done. The gray-haired
man listened gravely with an unmoved face, though a
trace of moisture crept into the little lady&#8217;s eyes. There
was silence for a moment or two when he had finished,
and then Major Radcliffe, whose manner was very quiet,
turned to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have laid me under an obligation, which I could
never wipe out, even if I wished it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was
my only son you buried out there in Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment, and his quietness was more
marked than ever when he went on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you have no doubt surmised, we quarreled,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;He was extravagant and careless&mdash;at least I
thought that then&mdash;but now it seems to me that I was unduly
hard on him. His mother&#8221;&mdash;and he turned to the
little lady with an inclination that pleased Wyllard curiously&mdash;&#8220;was
sure of it at the time. In any case, I took
the wrong way, and he went out to Canada. I made that,
at least, easy for him&mdash;and I have been sorry ever since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused again with a little expressive gesture. &#8220;It
seems due to him, and you, that I should tell you this.
When no word reached us I had inquiries made, through
a banker, who, discovering that he had registered at a
hotel as Pattinson, at length traced him to a British
Columbian silver mine. He had, however, left the mine
shortly before my correspondent learned that he had been
employed there, and all that the banker could tell me was
that an unknown prospector had nursed my boy until he
died.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard took out a watch and the clasp of a workman&#8217;s
belt from his pocket, and laid them gently on Mrs. Radcliffe&#8217;s
knee. He saw her eyes fill, and turned his head
away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel that you may blame me for not writing sooner,
but it was only a very little while ago that I was able to
trace you, and then it was only by a very curious&mdash;coincidence,&#8221;
he explained presently.
</p>
<p>He did not consider it advisable to mention the photograph.
It seemed to him that the girl would not like it.
Nor, though he was greatly tempted, did he care to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
inquiries concerning her just then. In another moment
or two the Major spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can make your stay here pleasanter in any way
I should be delighted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you will take up
your quarters with us I will send down to the inn for your
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard excused himself, but when Mr. Radcliffe urged
him to dine with them on the following evening he hesitated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The one difficulty is that I don&#8217;t know yet whether
I shall be engaged then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As it happens, I&#8217;ve
a message for Miss Ismay, and I wrote offering to call
upon her at any convenient hour. So far, I have heard
nothing from her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s away,&#8221; Mrs. Radcliffe informed him. &#8220;They
have probably sent your letter on to her. I had a note
from her yesterday, however, and expect her here to-morrow.
You have met some friends of hers in Canada?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory Hawtrey,&#8221; said Wyllard. &#8220;I have promised
to call upon his people, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw Major Radcliffe glance at his wife, and he
noticed a faint gleam in Mrs. Radcliffe&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;if you promise to come I will
send word over to Agatha.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard agreed to this, and went away a few minutes
later. He noticed the tact and consideration with which
his new friends had refrained from indicating any sign
of the curiosity they naturally felt, for Mrs. Radcliffe&#8217;s
face had suggested that she understood the situation, which
was beginning to appear a little more difficult to him. It
was, it seemed, his task to explain delicately to a girl
brought up among such people what she must be prepared
to face as a farmer&#8217;s wife in Western Canada. He was
not sure that this task would be easy in itself, but it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
rendered much more difficult by the fact that Hawtrey
would expect him to accomplish it without unduly daunting
her. Her letter certainly had suggested courage, but,
after all, it was the courage of ignorance, and he had
now some notion of the life of ease and refinement her
English friends enjoyed. He was beginning to feel sorry
for Agatha Ismay.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>AGATHA DOES NOT FLINCH</h3>
</div>

<p>The next evening Wyllard sat with Mrs. Radcliffe in a big
low-ceilinged room at Garside Scar. He looked about him
with quiet interest. He had now and then passed a day
or two in huge Western hotels, but he had never seen
anything quite like that room. The sheer physical comfort
of its arrangements appealed to him, but after all
he was not one who had ever studied his bodily ease very
much, and what he regarded as the chaste refinement of
its adornment had a deeper effect than a mere appeal to
the material side of his nature. Though he had lived for
the most part in the bush and on the prairie, he had
somehow acquired an artistic susceptibility.
</p>
<p>The furniture was old, and perhaps a trifle shabby,
but it was of beautiful design. Curtains, carpets and
tinted walls formed a harmony of soft coloring, and
there were scattered here and there dainty works of art,
little statuettes from Italy, and wonderful Indian ivory
and silver work. A row of low, stone-ribbed windows
pierced the front of the room. Looking out he saw the
trim garden lying in the warm evening light. Immediately
beneath the windows ran a broad graveled terrace,
which was evidently raked smooth every day, and a row
of urns in which hyacinths bloomed stood upon its pillared
wall. From the middle of the terrace a wide stairway
led down to the wonderful velvet lawn, which was
dotted with clumps of cupressus with golden gleams in it,
and beyond the lawn clipped yews rose smooth and solid
as a rampart of stone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>It all impressed him curiously&mdash;the order and beauty
of it, the signs of loving care. It gave him a key, he
fancied, to the lives of the cultured English people, for
there was no sign of strain and fret and stress and hurry
here. Everything, it seemed, went smoothly with rhythmic
regularity, and though it is possible that many Englishmen
would have regarded Garside Scar as a very
second-rate country house, and would have seen in Major
Radcliffe and his wife nothing more than a somewhat
prosy old soldier and a withered lady old-fashioned in
her dress and views, this Westerner had what was, perhaps,
a clearer vision. Wyllard could imagine the Major
standing fast at any cost upon some minute point of
honor, and it seemed to him that Mrs. Radcliffe, with
all the graces of an earlier age and the smell of the English
lavender upon her garments, might have stepped
down from some old picture. Then he remembered that,
after all, Englishwomen lived somewhat coarsely in the
Georgian days, and that he had met in Western Canada
hard-handed men grimed with dust and sweat who also
could stand fast by a point of honor. Though the fact
did not occur to him, he had, for that matter, done it more
than once himself.
</p>
<p>He recalled his wandering thoughts as his hostess smiled
at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are interested in all you see?&#8221; she asked frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Wyllard. &#8220;In fact, I&#8217;d like to spend some
hours here and look at everything. I&#8217;d begin at the pictures
and work right around.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Radcliffe&#8217;s smile suggested that she was not displeased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have been in London?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; said Wyllard. &#8220;I had one or two letters
to persons there, and they did all they could to entertain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
me. Still, their places were different; they
hadn&#8217;t the&mdash;charm&mdash;of yours. It&#8217;s something which I
think could exist only in these still valleys and in cathedral
closes. It strikes me more because it is something
I&#8217;ve never been accustomed to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Radcliffe was interested, and fancied that she
partly understood his attitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your life is necessarily different from ours,&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;It&#8217;s so different that you couldn&#8217;t
realize it. It&#8217;s all strain and effort from early sunrise until
after dusk at night. Bodily strain of aching muscles, and
mental stress in adverse seasons. We scarcely think of
comfort, and never dream of artistic luxury. The money
we make is sunk again in seed and extra teams and
plows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, a good many people are driven rather hard
by the love of money here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Wyllard rejoined gravely, &#8220;that&#8217;s not it exactly.
At least, not with the most of us. It&#8217;s rather the pride
of wresting another quarter-section from the prairie, taking&mdash;our
own&mdash;by labor, breaking the wilderness. You&#8221;&mdash;and
he added this as if to explain that he could hardly
expect her quite to grasp his views&mdash;&#8220;have never been out
West?&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hostess laughed. &#8220;I have stayed down in the plains
through the hot season in stifling cantonments, and have
once or twice been in Indian cholera camps. Besides, I
have seen my husband sitting, haggard and worn with
fever, in his saddle holding back a clamorous crowd that
surged about him half-mad with religious fury. There
were Hindus and Moslems to be kept from flying at each
other&#8217;s throats, and at a tactless word or sign of wavering,
either party would have pulled him down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to forgive me&#8221;&mdash;Wyllard&#8217;s gesture was
deprecatory, though his eyes twinkled. &#8220;The notion that
we&#8217;re the only ones who really work, or, at least, do anything
worth while, is rather a favorite one out West.
No doubt it&#8217;s a delusion. I should have known that all
of us are born like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Radcliffe forgave him readily, if only for the &#8220;all
of us,&#8221; which struck her as especially fortunate. A few
minutes later there were voices in the hall, and then the
door opened, and the girl whom he had met at the stepping
stones came in. She was dressed in trailing garments
which became her wonderfully, and he noticed now
the shapely delicacy of her hands and the fine, ivory pallor
of her skin. Mrs. Radcliffe turned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had better present you formally to Miss Ismay,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Agatha, this is Mr. Wyllard, who I understand
has brought you a message from Canada.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Wyllard was blankly astonished,
and for a moment the girl was clearly startled, too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; was all she said.
</p>
<p>She held out her hand before she turned to speak to
Mrs. Radcliffe. It was a relief to both when dinner was
announced.
</p>
<p>Wyllard sat next to his hostess, and was not sorry that
he was called upon to take part only in casual general
conversation. He thought once or twice that Miss Ismay
was unobtrusively studying him. It was nearly an hour
after the dinner when Mrs. Radcliffe left them alone in
the drawing-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have, no doubt, a good deal to talk about, and
you needn&#8217;t join us until you&#8217;re ready,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The
Major always reads the London papers after dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat in a low chair near the hearth, and it occurred
to Wyllard, who took a place opposite her, that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
was too delicate and dainty, too over-cultivated, in fact, to
marry Hawtrey. This was rather curious, since he had
hitherto regarded his comrade as a typical well-educated
Englishman; but it now seemed to him that there was a
certain streak of coarseness in Gregory. The man, it suddenly
flashed upon him, was self-indulgent, and the careless
ease of manner, which he had once liked, was too
much in evidence.
</p>
<p>Agatha turned to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that Gregory is recovering rapidly?&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>Wyllard assured her that Hawtrey was convalescing, and
Agatha said quietly, &#8220;He wants me to go out to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard felt that if a girl of that sort had promised
to marry him he would not have sent for her, but would
have come in person, if he had been compelled to pledge
his last possessions, or crawl to the tideway on his hands
and knees. For all that he was ready to defend his friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gregory was
quite unfit for such a journey when I left, and he must
be ready to commence the season&#8217;s campaign with the first
of the spring. Our summer is short, you see, and with
our one-crop farming it&#8217;s indispensable to get the seed in
early. In fact, he will be badly behind as it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was not particularly tactful, since, without intending
it, he made it evident that he felt his comrade had
been to some extent remiss; but Agatha smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I understand! You needn&#8217;t labor
with excuses. But doesn&#8217;t the same thing apply to you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly did. Now, however, things have become
a little easier. My holding is larger than Gregory&#8217;s, and
I have a foreman who can look after it for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory said that you were a great friend of his.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard seized this opportunity. &#8220;He was a great friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
of mine and I like to think it means the same thing. In
fact it&#8217;s reasonably certain that he saved my life for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Agatha; &#8220;that is a thing he didn&#8217;t
mention. How did it come about?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard was glad to tell the story. He was anxious
to say all he honestly could in Hawtrey&#8217;s favor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We were at work on a railroad trestle&mdash;a towering
wooden bridge, in British Columbia. It stretched across
a deep ravine with great boulders and there was a stream
in the bottom of it. He stood high up on a staging close
beneath the rails. A fast freight, a huge general produce
train came down the track, with one of the new big locomotives
hauling it, and when the cars went banging by
above us we could hardly hold on to the bridge. The construction
foreman was a hustler, and we had to get the
spikes in. I was swinging the hammer when I felt the
plank beneath me slip. The train, it seems, had jarred
loose the bolt around which we had our lashings. For a
moment I felt that I was going down into the gorge, and
then Gregory leaned out and grabbed me. He had only
one free hand to do it with, and when he felt my weight
one foot swung out from the stringer he had sprung to. It
seemed certain that I would pull him with me, too. We
hung like that for a space&mdash;I don&#8217;t quite know how long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, apparently feeling the stress
of it again, and there was a faint thrill in his voice when
he went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I knew just what kind of
man Gregory Hawtrey was. Anybody else would have
let me go; but he held on. I got my hand on some of the
framing, and he swung me on to the stringer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw the gleam in Agatha&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;that is just what he must have done. He was like that
always&mdash;impulsive, splendidly generous.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Wyllard felt that he had succeeded, though he knew
that there were men on the prairie who called his comrade
slackly careless, instead of impulsive. Agatha spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Gregory wasn&#8217;t a carpenter,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In those days when money was scarce we had to be
whatever we could. There wasn&#8217;t much specialization of
handicrafts out there then. The farmer whose crop was
ruined took up the railroad shovel, or borrowed a saw from
somebody and set about building houses, or anything else
that was wanted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; replied Agatha. &#8220;Besides, he was always
wonderfully quick. He could learn any game by just
watching it a while. He did all he undertook brilliantly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It occurred to Wyllard that Gregory had, at least, made
no great success of farming; but that occupation, as
practiced on the prairie, demands a great deal more than
quickness and what some call brilliancy from the man
who undertakes it. He must, as they say out there, possess
the capacity for staying with it&mdash;the grim courage to hold
fast the tighter under each crushing blow, when the grain
shrivels under the harvest frost, or when the ragged ice
hurtling before a roaring blast does the reaping. It was,
however, evident that this girl had an unquestioning faith
in Gregory Hawtrey, and once more Wyllard felt compassionate
towards her. He wondered if she would have retained
her confidence had Hawtrey spent those four years
in England instead of Canada, for it was clear from the
contrast between her and her picture that she had grown
in many ways since she had given her promise to her lover.
He had said what he could in Hawtrey&#8217;s favor, but now
he felt that something was due to the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory told me to explain what things are like out
there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it is because they are so different
from what you are accustomed to that he has waited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
so long. He wanted to make them as easy as possible for
you, and now he would like you to realize what is before
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was surprised at the girl&#8217;s quick comprehension, for
she glanced around the luxurious room with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look on me as part of&mdash;this? I mean it seems
to you that I fit in with my surroundings, and would be
in harmony only with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Wyllard gravely, &#8220;I think you fit in
with them excellently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was once, to a
certain extent, accustomed to something similar; though,
after all, one could hardly compare the Grange with Garside
Scar. Still, that was some time ago, and I have
earned my living for several years now. That counts for
something, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She glanced down at her dress. &#8220;For instance, this is
the result of a great deal of self-denial, though the cost of
it was partly worked off in music lessons, and the stuff
was almost the cheapest I could get. I sang at concerts&mdash;and
it was part of my stock in trade. After all, why
should you think me capable only of living in luxury?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go quite that far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed again. &#8220;Then is Canada such a very
dreadful place? I have heard of other Englishwomen
going out there as farmers&#8217; wives. Do they all live unhappily?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Wyllard, &#8220;at least, they show no sign of
it, and some of them and the city-born Canadians are, I
think, the salt of this earth. Probably it&#8217;s easy to be
calm and gracious in such a place as this&mdash;though naturally
I don&#8217;t know since I&#8217;ve never tried it&mdash;but when a
woman who toils from sunrise to sunset most of the year
keeps her sweetness and serenity, it&#8217;s a very different and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
much finer thing. But I&#8217;ll try to answer the other question.
The prairie isn&#8217;t dreadful; it&#8217;s a land of sunshine
and clear skies. Heat and cold&mdash;and we have them both&mdash;don&#8217;t
worry one there. There&#8217;s optimism in the crystal
air. It&#8217;s not beautiful like these valleys, but it has its
beauty. It is vast and silent, and, though our homesteads
are crude and new, once you pass the breaking, it&#8217;s primevally
old. That gets hold of one somehow. It&#8217;s wonderful
after sunset in the early spring, when the little cold
wind is like wine, and it runs white to the horizon with
the smoky red on the rim of it melting into transcendental
green. When the wheat rolls across the foreground in
ocher and burnished copper waves, it is more wonderful
still. One sees the fulfillment of the promise, and takes
courage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; asked Agatha, who had scarcely suspected him
of such appreciation of nature, &#8220;what is there to shrink
from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the case of a small farmer&#8217;s wife, the constant,
never-slackening strain. There&#8217;s no hired assistance. She
must clean the house, and wash, and cook, though it&#8217;s not
unusual for the men to wash the plates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl evidently was not much impressed, for she
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Gregory wash the plates?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;When Sproatly won&#8217;t,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Still, in a general way they do it only once a
week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; observed Agatha, &#8220;I can imagine Gregory hating
it. As a matter of fact, I like him for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the farmer&#8217;s wife must bake, and mend her husband&#8217;s
clothes. Indeed, it&#8217;s not unusual for her to mend
for the hired man, too. Besides that, there are always
odds and ends of tasks, but the time when you feel the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
strain most is in the winter. Then you sit at night, shivering
as a rule, beside the stove in an almost empty log-walled
room, reading a book you have probably read three
or four times before. Outside, the frost is Arctic; you
can hear the roofing shingles crackle now and then; and
you wake up when the fire burns low. There&#8217;s no life,
no company, rarely a new face, and if you go to a dance
or a supper somewhere, perhaps once a month, you ride
back on a bob-sled and are frozen almost stiff beneath the
robes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; interposed Agatha, &#8220;that does not last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man understood her. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; he said, &#8220;one makes
progress&mdash;that is, if one can stand the strain&mdash;but, as the
one way of doing it is to sow for a larger harvest and
break fresh sod every year, there can be no slackening in
the meanwhile. Every dollar must be guarded and
plowed into the soil again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, feeling that he had done all that could
reasonably be expected of him, and Agatha asked one question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman who didn&#8217;t slacken could make the struggle
easier for the man, couldn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Wyllard assured her, &#8220;in every way. Still, she
would have a great deal to bear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s face softened. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; she commented, &#8220;she
would not grudge the effort in the case of one she loved.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked up again with a smile. &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she
added, &#8220;if you really thought I should flinch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I first heard of it, I thought it quite likely.
Then when I read your letter my doubts vanished.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw that he had not been judicious, for there was,
for the first time, a trace of hardness in the girl&#8217;s expression.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He showed you that?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One small part of it,&#8221; assured Wyllard. &#8220;I want to
say that when I first saw this house, and how you seemed
fitted to it, my misgivings about Gregory&#8217;s decision troubled
me once more. Now,&#8221;&mdash;and he made an impressive gesture&mdash;&#8220;they
have vanished altogether, and they&#8217;ll never
come back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke as he felt. This girl, he knew, would feel the
strain; but it seemed to him that she had strength enough
to bear it cheerfully. In spite of her daintiness, she was
one who, in time of stress, could be depended on. He
often remembered afterwards how they had sat together
in the luxuriously furnished room, she leaning back in
her big, low chair, with the soft light on her delicately
tinted face. By and by he looked at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s curious that I had your photograph ever so long,
and never thought of showing it to Gregory,&#8221; he observed.
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled. &#8220;I suppose it is,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;After
all, except that it might have been a relief to Major Radcliffe
if he had met you sooner, the fact that you didn&#8217;t
show it to Gregory doesn&#8217;t seem of any particular consequence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard was not quite sure of this. He had thought
about this girl often, and certainly had been conscious of
a curious thrill of satisfaction when he had met her at
the stepping-stones. That feeling had suddenly disappeared
when he had learned that she was his comrade&#8217;s
promised wife. He had, however, during the last hour or
two made up his mind to think no more of her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;the next thing is to arrange for
Mrs. Hastings to meet you in London, or, perhaps, at the
Grange. Her husband is a Canadian, a man of education,
who has quite a large homestead not far from Gregory&#8217;s.
Her relatives are people of station in Montreal, and I feel
sure that you&#8217;ll like her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>They decided that he was to ask Mrs. Hastings to
stay a few days at the Grange, and then he looked at the
girl somewhat diffidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She suggests going in a fortnight,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled at him. &#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I must not
keep her waiting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose and they went back together to join their
hostess.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAVELING COMPANION</h3>
</div>

<p>A gray haze, thickened by the smoke of the city, drove
out across the water when the <i>Scarrowmania</i> lay in the
Mersey, with her cable hove short, and the last of the flood-tide
gurgling against her bows. A trumpeting blast of
steam swept high aloft from beside her squat funnel, and
the splash of the slowly turning paddles of the two steam
tugs that lay alongside mingled with the din it made. A
gangway from one of them to the <i>Scarrowmania&#8217;s</i> forward
deck, and a stream of frowsy humanity that had
just been released from overpacked emigrant boarding-houses
poured up it. There were apparently representatives
of all peoples and languages among that unkempt
horde&mdash;Britons, Scandinavians, Teutons, Italians, Russians,
Poles&mdash;and they moved on in forlorn apathy, like
cattle driven to the slaughter. One wondered how they
had raised their passage money, and how many years&#8217; bitter
self-denial it had cost them to provide for their transit
to the land of promise.
</p>
<p>At the head of the gangway stood the steamboat doctors,
for the <i>Scarrowmania</i> was taking out an unusual number
of passengers, and there were two of them. They were
immaculate in blue uniform, and looked very clean and
English by contrast with the mass of frowsy aliens. Beside
them stood another official, presumably acting on
behalf of the Dominion Government, though there were
few restrictions imposed upon Canadian immigration then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
nor, for that matter, did anybody trouble much about the
comfort of the steerage passengers. Each steamer carried
as many as she could hold.
</p>
<p>As the stream poured out of the gangway, the doctor
glanced at each newcomer&#8217;s face, and then seizing him
by the wrist uncovered it. Then he looked at the official,
who made a sign, and the man moved on. Since this took
him two or three seconds, one could have fancied that he
either possessed peculiar powers, or that the test was a
somewhat inefficient one.
</p>
<p>A group of first-class passengers, leaning on the thwartship
rails close by, looked on, with complacent satisfaction
or half-contemptuous pity. Among them stood Mrs. Hastings,
Miss Winifred Rawlinson, and Agatha. It was noticed
that Wyllard, with a pipe in his hand, sat on a hatch
forward, near the head of the gangway. Agatha drew
Mrs. Hastings&#8217; attention to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever is Mr. Wyllard doing there?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings, who was wrapped in furs, to protect her
from the sting in the east wind, smiled at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;is more than I can tell you;
but Harry Wyllard seems to find an interest in what other
folks would consider most unpromising things, and, what
is more to the purpose, he is rather addicted to taking a
hand in them. It is a habit that costs him something
now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha asked nothing further. She was interested in
Wyllard, but she was at the moment more interested in
the faces of those who swarmed on board. She wondered
what the emigrants had endured in the lands that had cast
them out; and what they might still have to bear. It
seemed to her that the murmur of their harsh voices went
up in a great protest, an inarticulate cry of sorrow. While
she looked on the doctor held back a long-haired man who,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
shuffling in broken boots, was following a haggard woman.
The physician drew him aside, and after he had consulted
with the other official, two seamen hustled the man towards
a second gangway that led to the tug. The woman raised
a wild, despairing cry. She blocked the passage, and a
quarter-master drove her, expostulating in an agony of
terror, forward among the rest. Nobody appeared concerned
about this alien&#8217;s tragedy, except one man, and
Agatha was not surprised when Wyllard rose and quietly
laid his hand upon the official&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>A parley appeared to follow, somebody gave an order,
and when the alien was led back again the woman&#8217;s cries
subsided. Agatha looked at Mrs. Hastings and once more
a smile crept into the older woman&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings, &#8220;I guessed he would feel
that he had to interfere. That is a man who can&#8217;t see any
one in trouble.&#8221; She added, with a little whimsical sigh,
&#8220;He had a bonanza harvest last fall, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They moved aft soon afterwards, and the <i>Scarrowmania</i>
was smoothly sliding seawards with the first of the ebb
when Agatha met Wyllard. He glanced at the Lancashire
sandhills, which were fading into a pale ocher gleam amid
the haze over the starboard hand, and then at the long row
of painted buoys that moved back to them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re off at last! The sad gray weather is dropping
fast astern,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Out yonder, the skies are clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; replied Agatha, &#8220;I&#8217;m to apply that as I
like? As a matter of fact, however, our days weren&#8217;t always
gray. But what was the trouble when those steerage
people came on board?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s manner, she noticed, was free alike from the
complacent self-satisfaction which occasionally characterizes
the philanthropist, and from any affectation of diffidence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;there was something wrong with
that woman&#8217;s husband. Nothing infectious, I believe, but
they didn&#8217;t seem to consider him a desirable citizen. They
make a warning example of somebody with a physical infirmity
now and then. The man, they decided, must be
put ashore again. In the meanwhile, somebody else had
hustled the woman forward, and it looked as if they would
take her on without him. The tug was almost ready to
cast off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221; said Agatha. &#8220;But what did you
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely promised to guarantee the cost of his passage
back if they would refer his case to the immigration people
at the other end. It is scarcely likely that they&#8217;ll make
trouble. As a rule, they only throw out folks who are certain
to become a charge on the community.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he really had any infirmity, mightn&#8217;t it lead
to that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Wyllard responded dryly. &#8220;I would engage to
give him a fair start if it was necessary. You wouldn&#8217;t
have had that woman landed in Montreal, helpless and
alone, while the man was sent back again to starve in
Poland?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw a curious gleam in Agatha&#8217;s eyes, and added in
a deprecating manner, &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve now and then limped
without a dollar into a British Columbian mining
town.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl was touched with compassion, but there was
another matter that must be mentioned, though she felt
that the time was inopportune.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rawlinson, who had only a second-class ticket,
insists upon being told how it is that she has been transferred
to the saloon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s eyes twinkled, but she noticed that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
wholly free from embarrassment, which was not quite the
case with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s a matter I must leave you to
handle. Anyway, she can&#8217;t go second-class now. One or
two of the steerage exchanged when they saw their quarters,
for which I don&#8217;t blame them, and they have filled
up every room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t answered the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard waved his hand. &#8220;Miss Rawlinson is your
bridesmaid, and I&#8217;m Gregory&#8217;s best man. It seems to me
it&#8217;s my business to do everything just as he would like it
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left her a moment later, and, though she did not
know how she was to explain the matter to Miss Rawlinson,
who was of an independent nature, it occurred to her that
he, at least, had found a rather graceful way out of the
difficulty. The more she saw of this Western farmer, the
more she liked him.
</p>
<p>It was after dinner when she next met him and the
wind had changed. The <i>Scarrowmania</i> was steaming
head-on into a glorious northwest breeze. The shrouds
sang; chain-guy, and stanchion, and whatever caught the
wind, set up a deep-toned throbbing; and ahead ranks of
little, white-topped seas rolled out of the night. A half-moon,
blurred now and then by wisps of flying cloud, hung
low above them, and odd spouts of spray that gleamed in
the silvery light leaped up about the dipping bows. Wyllard
was leaning on the rail when Agatha stopped beside him.
She glanced towards the lighted windows of the smoking-room
not far away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it you are not in there?&#8221; she asked, noticing
that he held a cigar in his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; answered Wyllard. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather full, and it
seemed that they didn&#8217;t want me. They&#8217;re busy playing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
cards, and the stakes are rather high. In a general way,
a steamboat&#8217;s smoking-room is less of a men&#8217;s lounge than
a gambling club.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you object to cards?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Wyllard replied with a smile. &#8220;They
merely make me tired, and when I feel I want some excitement
for my money I get it another way. That one
seems tame to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of excitement do you like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man laughed. &#8220;There are a good many that appeal
to me. Once it was collecting sealskins off other people&#8217;s
beaches, and there was zest enough in that, in view
of the probability of the dory turning over, or a gunboat
dropping on to you. Then there was a good deal of very
genuine excitement to be got out of placer-mining in British
Columbia, especially when there was frost in the
ranges, and you had to thaw out your giant-powder. Shallow
alluvial workings have a way of caving in when you
least expect it of them. After all, however, I think I like
the prairie farming best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that exciting?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Wyllard, &#8220;if you do it in one way.
The gold&#8217;s there&mdash;that you&#8217;re sure of&mdash;piled up by nature
during I don&#8217;t know how many thousand years, but you
have to stake high, if you want to get much of it out. One
needs costly labor,&mdash;teams&mdash;no end of them&mdash;breakers, and
big gang-plows. The farmer who has nerve enough
drills his last dollar into the soil in spring, but if he means
to succeed it costs him more than that. He must give the
sweat of his tensest effort, the uttermost toil of his body&mdash;all,
in fact, that has been given him. Then he must shut
his eyes tight to the hazards against him, or look at them
without wavering&mdash;the drought, the hail, the harvest frost,
I mean. If his teams fall sick, or the season goes against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
him, he must work double tides. Still, it now and then
happens that things go right, and the red wheat rolls ripe
right back across the prairie. I don&#8217;t know that any man
could want a keener thrill than the one he feels when he
drives in the binders!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha had imagination, and she could realize something
of the toil, the hazard, and the exultation of that victory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have felt it often?&#8221; she inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twice we helped to fill a big elevator,&#8221; Wyllard answered.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ve been very near defeat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked at him thoughtfully. It seemed that
he possessed the power of acquisition, as well as a wide
generosity that came into play when by strenuous effort
success had been attained. So far as her experience went,
these were things that did not invariably accompany each
other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And when the harvest comes up to your expectations,
you give your money away?&#8221; she asked with a lifting of
her brows.
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed. &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t deduce too much
from a single instance. Besides, that Pole&#8217;s case hasn&#8217;t
cost me anything yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings joined them, and when Wyllard strolled
away the women passed some time leaning on the rails,
and looking at the groups of shadowy figures on the forward
deck. The attitude of the steerage passengers was
dejected and melancholy, but one cluster had gathered
around a man who stood upon the hatch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;you&#8217;ll have no trouble. Canada&#8217;s
a great country for a poor man. He can sleep beneath a
bush all summer, if he can&#8217;t strike anything he likes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This did not appear particularly encouraging, but the
orator went on: &#8220;Been over for a trip to the Old Country,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
and I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m going back again. Went out with
nothing except a good discharge, and they made me Sergeant
of Canadian Militia. After that I was armorer to
a rifle club. There&#8217;s places a blame long way behind the
Dominion, and I struck one of them when we went with
Roberts to Afghanistan. It was on that trip I and a Pathan
rolled all down a hill, him trying to get his knife
arm loose, and me jabbing his breastbone with my bayonet
before I got it into him. I drove it through to the socket.
You want to make quite sure of a Pathan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Rawlinson winced at this. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;what a horrible man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was &#8217;most as tough as when you went after Riel,
and stole the Scotchman&#8217;s furs,&#8221; suggested a Canadian.
</p>
<p>The sergeant let the jibe go by. He said: &#8220;Louis&#8217;s
bucks could shoot! We had them corraled in a pit, and
every time one of the boys from Montreal broke cover he
got a bullet into him. Did any of you ever hear a dropped
man squeal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha had heard sufficient, and she and her companions
turned away, but as they moved across the deck the sergeant&#8217;s
voice followed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a grand country for a poor man.
In the summer he can sleep beneath a bush.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For some reason this eulogy haunted Agatha when she
retired to her stateroom that night, and she wondered
what awaited all those aliens in the new land. It occurred
to her that in some respects she was situated very much as
they were. For the first time, vague misgivings crept into
her mind as she realized that she had cut herself adrift
from all to which she had been accustomed. She felt suddenly
depressed and lonely.
</p>
<p>The depression had, however, almost vanished when,
awakening rather early next morning, she went up on deck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
A red sun hung over the tumbling seas that ran into the
hazy east astern. The waves rolled up in crested phalanxes
that gleamed green and incandescent white ahead.
The <i>Scarrowmania</i> plunged through them with a spray
cloud flying about her dipping bows. She was a small,
old-fashioned boat, and because she carried 3,000 tons
of railway iron she rolled distressfully. Her tall spars
swayed athwart the vivid blueness of the morning sky
with the rhythmic regularity of a pendulum. The girl was
not troubled by any sense of sea-sickness. The keen north-wester
that sang amid the shrouds was wonderfully fresh;
and, when she met Wyllard crossing the saloon deck, her
cheeks were glowing from the sting of the spray, and her
eyes were bright.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Down there,&#8221; answered Wyllard, pointing to the black
opening in the fore-hatch that led to the steerage quarters.
&#8220;An acquaintance of mine who&#8217;s traveling forward
asked me to take a look round, and I&#8217;m rather glad I did.
When I&#8217;ve had a word with the chief steward I&#8217;m going
back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a friend down there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I met the man for the first time yesterday, and rather
took to him. One of your naval petty officers, forcibly retired.
He can&#8217;t live upon his pension, that is why he&#8217;s
going out to Canada. Now you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; ventured Agatha, &#8220;if you would let me go
back with you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard looked at her curiously. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with
an air of reflection, &#8220;you&#8217;ll probably have to face a good
deal that you don&#8217;t like out yonder, and in one way you
won&#8217;t suffer from a little preparatory training. This,
however, is not a case where sentimental pity is likely to
relieve anybody. It&#8217;s the real thing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I told you at Garside Scar that I haven&#8217;t lived
altogether in luxury!&#8221; she replied.
</p>
<p>Wyllard, who made no comment, disappeared, and
merely signed to her when he came back. They reached
the ladder that led down into the gloom beneath the hatch,
and Agatha hesitated when a sour and musty odor floated
up to her. She went down, however, and a few moments
later stood, half-nauseated, gazing at the wildest scene of
confusion her eyes had ever rested on. A little light came
down the hatchway, and a smoky lamp or two swung above
her head, but half the steerage deck was wrapped in
shadow, and out of it there rose a many-voiced complaining.
Flimsy, unplaned fittings had wrenched away, and
men lay inert amid the wreckage, with the remains of their
last meal scattered about them. There were unwashed tin
plates and pannikins, knives, and spoons, sliding up and
down everywhere, and the deck was foul with slops of tea,
and trodden bread, and marmalade. Now and then, in a
wilder roll than usual, a frowsy, huddled object slid groaning
down the slant of slimy planking, but in every case the
helpless passenger was fully dressed. Steerage passengers,
in fact, seldom take off their clothes. For one thing, all
their worldly possessions are, as a rule, secreted among
their garments, and for another, most of those hailing
from beyond the Danube have never been accustomed to
disrobing. In the midst of the confusion, two half-sick
steward lads were making ineffective efforts to straighten
up the mess.
</p>
<p>Agatha made out that a swarm of urchins were huddled
together in a helpless mass along one side of the horrible
place. The sergeant was haranguing them, while another
man, whom she supposed to be the petty officer, pulled
them to their feet one by one. A good deal of his labor
was wasted, for the <i>Scarrowmania</i> was rolling viciously,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
and as soon as a few were placed upright half of them
collapsed again. Wyllard glanced towards the boys compassionately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe most of them have had nothing to eat since
they came on board, though it isn&#8217;t the company&#8217;s fault,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s food enough served out, but before we
picked the breeze up the men laid hands upon it first and
half of it was wasted in the scramble. Then it seems they
pitched these youngsters out of their berths.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they belong to anybody?&#8221; Agatha asked. &#8220;Is
there no one to look after them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;I believe one of your charitable institutions
is sending them out, and there seems to be a
clergyman, who has a curate and a lay assistant to help
him, in charge of them. The assistant won&#8217;t be available
while this rolling lasts, and the other two very naturally
prefer the saloon. In a way, that&#8217;s comprehensible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He left her, and proceeded to help the man who was
dragging the urchins to their feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; commanded the sergeant. &#8220;Get up, and
fall in. Dress from the left, and number off, the ones
who can stand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It appeared that the lads had been drilled, for they
scrambled into a line that bent and wavered each time the
<i>Scarrowmania&#8217;s</i> bows went down. After that, every other
lad stepped forward at the word. The order was, &#8220;Left
turn. March, and fall in on deck,&#8221; and when they feebly
clambered up the ladder Wyllard, who turned to Agatha,
pointed to a door in a bulkhead of rough white wood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It should have been locked, but I fancy you can get
in that way, and up through another hatch,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;The single women, and women with children, are in yonder,
and if you want to be useful there&#8217;s a field for you.
Get as many as possible up on deck.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Agatha left him, and her face was rather white when at
last she came up into the open air, with about a dozen forlorn,
draggled women trailing helplessly after her. The
lads were now sitting down in a double line on deck, each
with a tin plate and a steaming pannikin in front of him.
There were at least a hundred of them, and a man with a
bronzed face and the stamp of command upon him was
giving them the order of the voyage. He was the one she
had already noticed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll turn out at the whistle at half-past six,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Shake mattresses, roll up blankets, and prepare
for berth inspection. Then, at the next whistle, you&#8217;ll
fall in on deck stripped to the waist for washing parade.
Fourth files numbering even are orderlies in charge of the
plates and pannikins.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; announced the sergeant, &#8220;any insubordination
will be sharply dealt with. Now, when I was with Roberts
in Afghanistan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard, who was standing close by, turned to
Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be wanted. You have probably
earned your breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back to the saloon deck, and the girl smiled
when he looked at her inquiringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a little horrible, but I hadn&#8217;t so many to deal
with,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do you, and those others, expect to
bring any order out of that chaos?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Wyllard, &#8220;with a little encouragement
they&#8217;ll do it themselves. That is, the English, Danes, and
Germans. One can trust them to evolve a workable system.
It&#8217;s in their nature. You can trace most things
that tend to wholesome efficiency back to the old Teutonic
leaven. By and by, they&#8217;ll proceed to put some pressure
on the Latins, Slavs, and Jews.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But is it your business to offer them that encouragement?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed. &#8220;Strictly speaking, it isn&#8217;t in the
least, but unnecessary chaos is hateful, and, any way, I&#8217;m
not the only one who doesn&#8217;t seem to like it. There&#8217;s the
petty officer, and our friend, the sergeant, who was with
Roberts in Afghanistan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha said nothing further. She was a little surprised
to feel that she was anxious to keep this man&#8217;s good
opinion, though that was not exactly why she had nerved
herself for the venture into the single women&#8217;s quarters.
Leaving him out altogether, it seemed to her that there was
something rather fine in the way that the sergeant and the
petty officer who was going out almost penniless to Canada,
had saddled themselves with the task of looking after those
helpless lads. It was wholly unpaid labor, for which the
men who preferred to remain within the safe limits of the
saloon deck would presumably get the credit. After all,
she decided, there were, no doubt, men in every station
who helped to keep the world sweet and clean, and she believed
that Wyllard was to be counted among them. He
certainly differed in many ways from Gregory, but then
Gregory was unapproachable. She did not remember that
it was four years since she had seen Hawtrey, and that
her ideas had been a little unformed then.
</p>
<p>In the evening, Mrs. Hastings, with whom he was evidently
a favorite, happened to speak of Wyllard, and the
efforts he was making in the steerage, and Agatha asked a
question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he often undertake this kind of thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Mrs. Hastings answered with a smile. &#8220;Any
way, not on so large a scale. He&#8217;s very far from setting
up as a professional philanthropist, my dear. I don&#8217;t remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
his offering to point out duty to other folks, and I
don&#8217;t think he goes about in search of an opportunity of
benefiting humanity. Still, when an individual case
thrusts itself beneath his nose, he generally does what he
can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard people say that the individual method only
perpetuates the trouble,&#8221; remarked Agatha.
</p>
<p>Mrs Hastings shook her head. &#8220;That,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is
a subject I&#8217;m not well posted on, but it seems to me that
if other folks only adopted Harry Wyllard&#8217;s simple plan,
there would be considerably less need for organized charity.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE FOG</h3>
</div>

<p>During the next two days before a moderate gale the <i>Scarrowmania</i>
shouldered her way westwards through the big,
white-topped combers that rolled down upon her under a
lowering sky. There were no luxurious, steam-propelled
hotels in the Canadian trade at this time, and loaded deep
with railway metal as she was, the vessel slopped in the
green seas everywhere, and rolled her streaming sides out
almost to her bilge. She shivered and rattled horribly
when her single screw swung clear and the tri-compound
engines ran away.
</p>
<p>Wyllard went down to the steerage every now and then,
and Agatha, who contrived to keep on her feet, not infrequently
accompanied him. She was glad of his society,
for Mrs. Hastings was seldom in evidence, and no efforts
could get Miss Rawlinson out of her berth. The gale blew
itself out at length, and the evening after it moderated
Agatha was sitting near the head of one fiddle-guarded
table in the saloon waiting for dinner, which the stewards
had still some difficulty in bringing in. Wyllard&#8217;s place
was next to hers, but he had not appeared, nor had the
skipper, who, however, did not invariably dine with the
passengers. One of the two doors which led from the foot
of the branching companion stairway into either side of
the saloon stood open, and presently she saw Wyllard standing
just outside it.
</p>
<p>He beckoned to the doctor, who sat at the foot of her
table, and the physician merely raised his brows a trifle.
He was a rather consequential person, and it was evident
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
to the girl that he resented being summoned by a gesture.
She did not think anybody else had noticed Wyllard, and
she waited with some curiosity to see what he would do.
He made a sign with a lifted hand, and she felt that the
doctor would obey it, as, in fact, he did, though his manner
was very far from conciliatory. By dint of listening
closely, she could hear their conversation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to trouble you just now,&#8221; apologized Wyllard,
&#8220;and I didn&#8217;t come in because that would have set
everybody wondering what you were wanted for; but one
of those boys forward has been thrown down the ladder,
and has cut his head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see to him&mdash;after dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nasty cut,&#8221; declared Wyllard. &#8220;He&#8217;s losing a
good deal of blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I would suggest that you apply to my assistant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I don&#8217;t know where he is, I have come to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The doctor made a sign of impatience. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
said &#8220;you have told me, which I think is as far as your
concern in the matter goes. I may add that I&#8217;m not accustomed
to dictation on behalf of a steerage passenger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha saw Wyllard slip between the doctor and the
entrance to the saloon, but she saw also the skipper appear
a few paces behind them, and glance at them sharply. He
was usually a silent man, at home in the ice and the
clammy fog, but not a great acquisition in the saloon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something wrong down forward, Mr. Wyllard? They
were making a great row a little while ago,&#8221; the skipper
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very serious,&#8221; Wyllard answered. &#8220;One of
the boys has cut his head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The skipper turned towards the doctor and Agatha
guessed that he had overheard part of the conversation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you had better go&mdash;at once?&#8221; suggested
the skipper.
</p>
<p>The doctor evidently did, for he disappeared; and Wyllard,
who entered the saloon with the skipper, sat down at
Agatha&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do it?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; returned Wyllard, beginning his dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll say persuade other folks to see things as you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You evidently mean the skipper, and I suppose you
heard something of what was going on. In this case, I&#8217;m
indebted to his prejudices. He&#8217;s one of the old type&mdash;a
seaman first of all&mdash;and what we call bluff, and you call
bounce, has only one effect upon men of his kind. It gets
their backs up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha thought that he did not like it, either, but she
changed the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There really was a row forward,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What
was the trouble over? You were, no doubt, somewhere
near the scene of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed. &#8220;I sat upon the steerage ladder, and
am afraid I cheered the combatants on. It was really a
glorious row. They hammered each other with tin plates,
and some of them tried to use hoop-iron knives, which fortunately
doubled up. They broke quite a few of the
benches, and wrecked the mess table, but so far as I noticed
the only one seriously hurt was a little chap who was
quietly looking on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you encouraged them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did. It was a protest against dirt, disorder,
and the slothfulness that&#8217;s a plague to the community.
Isn&#8217;t physical force warranted when there&#8217;s no
other remedy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A gray-haired Canadian looked up. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed,
&#8220;I guess it is. The first man who pulled his gun in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
British Columbia was hanged right away, and they&#8217;ve
scarcely had to make an example of another since then,
though it was quite a while ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, and smiled approvingly. &#8220;A mess of any
kind worries us, and we don&#8217;t take long to straighten it
out. Same feeling&#8217;s in the Germans and Scandinavians.
I&#8217;ll say that for them, any way. Your friends swept up
the steerage?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They took the Slavs and Jews, and pitched them down
the second hatch on to the orlop deck. Things will go
smoothly now our crowd is on top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your crowd?&#8221; said Agatha.
</p>
<p>The Canadian nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s what he meant,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;There are two kinds of folks you and the rest of
them are dumping into Canada. One&#8217;s the kind that will
get up and hustle, break land, and build new homes&mdash;log
at first, frame and stone afterwards. They go on from a
quarter-section and a team of oxen to the biggest farm
they can handle, and every fresh furrow they cut enriches
all of us. The other kind want to sit down in the dirt
and take life easily, as they&#8217;ve always done. The dirt
worries everybody else, and we&#8217;ve no use for them. By
and by our Legislature will have to wake up and stop
them from getting in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went on with his dinner, but his observations left
Agatha thoughtful. She was beginning to understand one
side of Wyllard&#8217;s character. He, it seemed, stood for practical
efficiency. There was a driving force in him that
made for progress and order. It was apparently his mission
to straighten things out. Some persons of his kind,
she reflected, now and then made a good deal of avoidable
trouble; but there was in this man, at least, a half-whimsical
toleration, which rendered that an unlikely thing in his
particular case. Besides, she had already recognized that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
she was in some respects fortunate in having such a man
for her companion.
</p>
<p>Her deck chair was always set out in the most sheltered
and comfortable place. If there was anything to be seen
he almost invariably appeared with a pair of powerful
glasses. She was watched over, her wishes were anticipated,
and the man was seldom obtrusively present when
she felt disposed to talk to somebody else. It struck her
that she had thought a great deal about him during the
last few days, and rather less than usual about Gregory,
which was partly the reason she did not walk up and down
the deck with him, as usual, after dinner that evening.
</p>
<p>Three or four days later, the <i>Scarrowmania</i> ran into
the Bank fog, and burrowed through it with whistle hooting
dolefully at regular intervals. Now and then an answering
ringing of bells came out of the clammy vapor,
and the half-seen shape of an anchored schooner loomed
up, rolling wildly on gray slopes of sea. Once, too, a tiny
dory, half filled with lines and buoys, slid by plunging on
the wash flung off by the <i>Scarrowmania&#8217;s</i> bows, and Agatha
understood that the men in her had escaped death by a
hairsbreadth. They were cod fishers, Wyllard told her,
and he added that there was a host of them at work somewhere
in the sliding haze. She imagined, now and then,
that the fog had a depressing effect on him, and that when
the dory lay beneath the rail there had been an unusual
look in his face.
</p>
<p>A breeze came out of the northwest, with the sting of
the ice in it, but the fog did not lift, and the <i>Scarrowmania</i>
plunged on through it with spray-wet decks and the
gray seas smashing about her bows. It was bitterly cold
and the raw wind pierced to the bone, but the voyage was
rapidly shortening.
</p>
<p>One evening Agatha paced the deck with Wyllard. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
girl was in a strangely unsettled mood. Perhaps it was
merely the gloom of the sea and sky reacting upon her
that caused her to look forward to the landing with a certain
half-conscious shrinking. They stopped by the rails
presently, looking out upon the tumbling seas that, tipped
with livid froth, rolled out of the sliding haze, and the
dreariness of the surroundings intensified the girl&#8217;s depression.
There was something unpleasantly suggestive in the
sight of the fog that hid everything, for Agatha had been
troubled with a half-apprehensive longing to see what lay
before her. She noticed the lookout, a lonely, shapeless
figure, standing amid the spray that whirled about the
plunging bows. By and by she saw him turn and wave
an arm toward the bridge behind her, and she heard a
hoarse cry. What it meant she could not tell, but in another
moment the <i>Scarrowmania&#8217;s</i> whistle shrieked.
</p>
<p>A gray shape burst out of the vapor and grew with astonishing
swiftness into dim tiers of slanted sailcloth swaying
above a strip of hull that moved amid a broad white
smear of foam. It was a brig under fore-course and topsails,
and as the girl watched the vessel it sank to the tilted
bowsprit, and a big gray and white sea foamed about the
bows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t we dreadfully near?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Wyllard did not answer. He was gazing up at the
bridge, and once more the whistle gave a warning blast.
It seemed that the two vessels could hardly pass clear of
each other.
</p>
<p>Wyllard laid a hand upon Agatha&#8217;s shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The skipper&#8217;s starboarding. We&#8217;ll go around to the
stern,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>His grasp was reassuring, and Agatha watched the
straining curves of canvas and the line of half-submerged
hull. The brig rose with streaming bows, swung high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
above the sea, sank again, and vanished with bewildering
suddenness into a belt of driving fog.
</p>
<p>Agatha was not sure that there had been any peril, but
it was certainly past now, and she was rather puzzled by
her sensations when Wyllard had held her shoulder. For
one thing, she had felt instinctively that she was safe with
him. She decided not to trouble herself about the reason
for this, and presently she looked up at him. The expression
that she had noticed now and then was once more
in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you like the fog any more than I do,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; responded Wyllard, with a quiet forcefulness that
startled her. &#8220;I hate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It recalls something that still gives me a very bad few
minutes every once in a while. It has been worrying me
again to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Agatha simply, &#8220;if you would care to
tell me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man looked down on her. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t told it often,
but you shall hear,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It&#8217;s a tale of a black
failure.&#8221; He stretched out a hand and pointed to the
ranks of tumbling seas. &#8220;It was very much this kind of
night, and we were lying, reefed down, off one of the Russians&#8217;
beaches, when I asked for volunteers. I got them&mdash;two
boats&#8217; crews of the finest seamen that ever handled
oar or sealing rifle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what did you want them for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A boat from another schooner had been cast ashore.
It was blowing hard, as it usually does where the Polar ice
comes down into the Behring Sea. They&#8217;d been shooting
seals. We meant to bring the men off if we could manage
it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t one boat have been enough?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Wyllard dryly, &#8220;we had three, and I
think that was one cause of the trouble. There was one
from the other schooner. You see, those seals belonged to
the Russians, and we free-lances could shoot them only off
shore. I&#8217;m not sure that the men in the wrecked boat had
been fishing outside the limit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha did not press for further particulars, and he
went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We managed to make a landing, though one boat went
up bottom uppermost. I fancy they must have broken or
lost an oar then. We got the wrecked men, but we had
trouble while we were getting the boats off again. The
surf was running in savagely, and the fog shut down as
solid as a wall. Any way, we pulled off, and went out
with a foot of water in one boat. One of the rescued men
took my oar when I let it go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you let it go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed in a grim fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My head was laid open with a sealing club,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Some of the other men had their scratches, but they
managed to row. For one thing, they knew they had to.
They had reasons for not wanting to fall into the Russians&#8217;
hands. Well, we cleared the beach, and once or
twice, as I tried to bale, there was a shout somewhere near
us, and the loom of a vanishing boat. It was all we could
make out, for the sea was slopping into the boat, and the
spray was flying everywhere. If there had been only two
boats we probably would have found out our misfortune,
and perhaps would have set it straight. As it was, we
couldn&#8217;t tell that it was the same boat that had hailed
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment, and then added quietly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two boats reached the schooners. There was a nasty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
sea running then, and it blew viciously hard next day.
There were three men in the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; cried Agatha, &#8220;they were drowned?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made a forceful gesture. &#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure.
That&#8217;s the trouble. At least, the boat was nowhere on the
beach next day, and it&#8217;s difficult to see how the men could
have faced the sea that piled up when the gale came down.
In all probability, they had an oar short, and the boat
rolled them out when a comber broke upon her in the darkness.&#8221;
The girl saw him close one hand tight as he added,
&#8220;If one only knew!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What would have befallen them if they had reached
shore?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to say. They could have been handed
over to the Russian authorities. Still, sealers poaching
up there have simply disappeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped again, and glanced out at the gathering
darkness. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;you see why I hate the
fog.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you couldn&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Wyllard, &#8220;I asked for volunteers,
and the money that is now mine came out of those schooners.
It&#8217;s just possible those men are living still&mdash;somewhere
in Northern Asia. I only know that they disappeared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He abruptly began to talk of something else, and by and
by Agatha went down to the saloon, where Miss Rawlinson,
who had not been much in evidence during the voyage,
presently made her appearance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going into the music-room to play for Mr.
Wyllard&mdash;as usual?&#8221; she inquired.
</p>
<p>Agatha was disconcerted. She had fallen into the habit
of spending half an hour or longer in the little music-room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
every evening, with Wyllard standing near the piano; but
now her friend&#8217;s question seemed to place a significance
upon the fact.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the rest of them will wonder whether you have
fallen out with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fallen out with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred laughed. &#8220;They&#8217;ve naturally been watching
both of you, and, in a general way, there&#8217;s only one decision
they could have arrived at.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha flushed a little, but Winifred went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind admitting that if a man of that kind
was to fall in love with me, I&#8217;d black his boots for him,&#8221;
she said. She added, with a rueful gesture, &#8220;Still, it&#8217;s
most unlikely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked at her with a little glint in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is merely Gregory&#8217;s deputy,&#8221; she said, with a subconscious
feeling that the word &#8220;deputy&#8221; was not a fortunate
one. &#8220;In that connection, I should like to point
out that you can estimate a man&#8217;s character by that of his
friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; rejoined Winifred, &#8220;then if Mr. Wyllard&#8217;s strong
points merely heighten Gregory&#8217;s virtues, I&#8217;ve nothing
more to say. Any way, I&#8217;ll reserve my homage until I&#8217;ve
seen Gregory. Perfection among men is scarce nowadays.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned away, and left Agatha thoughtful. In the
meanwhile, Mrs. Hastings came upon Wyllard alone in
the music-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look quite serious,&#8221; she remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about Miss Ismay and Gregory,&#8221;
Wyllard replied. &#8220;In fact, I feel a little anxious about
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Without making any reflections upon Gregory, I somewhat
feel sorry for the girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings nodded. &#8220;As a matter of fact, that&#8217;s
very much what I felt from the first,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;Still,
you see, there&#8217;s the important fact that she&#8217;s fond of him,
and it should smooth out a good many difficulties. Anyway,
she&#8217;s evidently rather a courageous person.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard sat silent a moment or two. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t troubling
about the material difficulties&mdash;lack of wealth and all
that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was wondering if she really could be
fond of him. It is some years since she was much in his
company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hawtrey is not a man to change.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; returned Wyllard, &#8220;is just the trouble. I&#8217;ve
no doubt he&#8217;s much the same, but one could fancy that Miss
Ismay has changed a good deal since she last saw him.
She&#8217;ll look for considerably more than she was probably
content with then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, it isn&#8217;t your affair.&#8221; Mrs. Hastings
smiled significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In one sense it certainly isn&#8217;t; but I can&#8217;t help feeling
a little troubled about the thing. You see, Gregory is
quite an old friend.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the girl is going to marry him,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings,
raising her eyebrows.
</p>
<p>Wyllard rose. &#8220;That reminder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is quite uncalled
for. I would like to assure you of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out, and Mrs. Hastings sat still in a reflective
mood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If she begins to compare him with Hawtrey, there can
be only one result,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>The fog had almost gone next morning, and pale sunshine
streamed down upon a a froth-flecked sea. A bitter
wind, however, still came out of the hazy north, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
<i>Scarrowmania&#8217;s</i> plates were crusted with ice where the
highest crests of the tumbling seas reached them. The
spray froze, and the decks grew slippery. When darkness
came, nobody but the seamen faced the stinging cold.
Agatha felt the engines stop late that night, and when she
went out next morning the decks were white, and she could
see dim ghosts of sliding pines through a haze of falling
snow that became bewilderingly thick at times, but the
steamer slid on through it with whistle hooting. At last
toward sunset the snow cleared away and Agatha stood
shivering under a deck-house. She looked about her with
a curiously heavy heart.
</p>
<p>A gray haze stretched across the great river, which was
dim and gray, and odd wisps of pines rose raggedly beneath
the white hills that cut against a gloomy, lowering
sky. Deck-house, boat, and stanchion dripped, and every
now and then the silence was broken by a doleful blast
of the whistle. Nothing moved on the still, gray water,
there was no sign of life ashore, and they seemed to be
steaming into a great desolation.
</p>
<p>Presently, Wyllard appeared from somewhere, and, after
a glance at her face, slipped his hand beneath her arm, and
led her down to the lighted saloon. There her heart grew
a little lighter. Once more she was conscious of the feeling
that she was safe with him.

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>DISILLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>The long train was speeding smoothly across the vast
white levels of Assiniboia, when Agatha, who sat by a window,
looked up as the conductor strode through the car.
Mrs. Hastings asked him a question, and he stopped a
moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll be in Clermont inside half an
hour.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went on, and Mrs. Hastings smiled at Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a little late, and Gregory will be waiting for us
in the station now,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;No doubt he&#8217;s got
the wagon fixed up right, but I&#8217;d like to feel sure of it.
There&#8217;s a long drive before us, and I want to reach the
homestead before it&#8217;s dark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha said nothing, but a faint tinge of color crept
into her cheeks, and Mrs. Hastings was glad to see it, for
she had noticed that the girl was looking pale and haggard.
The strain of the last few months that she had
spent in England was beginning to tell on her. She had
borne it courageously, but a reaction had set in, and the
trip had been fatiguing. The <i>Scarrowmania</i> had plunged
along, bows under, against fresh northwesterly gales most
of the way across the Atlantic, and there is very little comfort
on board a small, deeply-loaded steamer when she
rolls her rails in, and lurches with thudding screw swung
clear over big, steep-sided combers. Moreover, Agatha
had scarcely slept during the few days and nights that she
had spent in the train. It takes time to become accustomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
to the atmosphere of a heated sleeper, and since she
had landed she had been in a state of not unnatural nervous
tension.
</p>
<p>She had found it difficult to preserve an outward serenity,
the previous day. When, at last, the great train ran
into the depôt at Winnipeg, where Gregory had arranged
to meet them, it was with a thrill of expectancy and relief
that she stood upon the car platform. There was, however,
no sign of Gregory, and, though Wyllard handed her
a telegram from him a few minutes later, the fact that he
had not arrived had a depressing effect on her. Quiet as
she usually was, the girl was highly strung. Something
had gone wrong with Hawtrey&#8217;s wagon while he was driving
in to the railroad, and as the result of it he had missed
the Atlantic train. She could not blame him for the accident,
but for all that his absence was an unpleasant shock.
</p>
<p>Feeling that her companions&#8217; eyes were upon her, she
turned, and looking out of the window found no encouragement
in what she saw. The snow had gone, and a vast
expanse of grass ran back to the horizon! But it was a
dingy, grayish-white, and not green, as it had been in England.
The sky was low and gray, too, and the only thing
that broke the dreary monotony of lifeless color was the
formless, darker smear of a birch bluff that rose out of the
empty levels. Her heart throbbed unpleasantly fast as the
few remaining minutes slipped away. She started when a
dingy mass of something that looked like buildings lifted
itself above the prairie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Clermont elevators,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
be in directly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mass separated itself into two or three tall component
blocks. A huddle of little wooden houses grew into
shape beneath them, and a shrill whistle came ringing back
above the slowing cars. A willow bluff, half filled with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
old cans and garbage, flitted by, a big bell began tolling,
and Agatha rose when Mrs. Hastings took up her furs
from a seat close by. After that, the girl found herself
standing on the platform of the car, though she did not
quite know how she got there, for she was sensible only of
the fact that in another moment or two she would greet
the lover whom she had not seen for four years.
</p>
<p>Though she paid no great attention to them the surroundings
had a depressing effect on her. There was, however,
very little to see. The mass of the great elevators
that were silhouetted against a lowering sky, the little
cluster of houses, and the sea of churned-up mire between
them and the track comprised Clermont. There appeared
to be no station except a big water tank and a rather unsightly
shed, about which stood a group of blurred and
shapeless figures. It seemed very cold, and Agatha shivered
as she felt the raw wind strike through her.
</p>
<p>One of the figures detached itself from the rest and grew
clearer. The man wore an old skin coat spattered with
flakes of mire, and his long boots were covered with clots
of mud. His fur cap looked greasy, and the fur had been
rubbed off it in patches. But while Agatha noticed these
things it was Hawtrey&#8217;s face that struck her most distinctly,
and she became conscious of an astonishment which
was mixed with vague misgivings as she gazed at it, for it
had subtly changed since she had last seen it. The joyous
sparkle that she remembered had gone out of the eyes.
They were harder, bolder, than they used to be. The
mouth was slack&mdash;it looked almost sensual&mdash;and the man&#8217;s
whole personality seemed to have grown coarser. As she
thrust the disconcerting fancies from her the car stopped.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 352px;'>
&#8220;SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CERTAIN SHRINKING FROM HIS EMBRACE&#8221; <i>Page</i> 107
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>In another moment Hawtrey sprang up on the platform,
and his arms were about her. That brought the blood to
her face, but she felt none of the thrill that she had
expected. Indeed, she was conscious of a certain shrinking
from his embrace. He must have lifted her down, for, when
she was next aware of the presence of the friends with
whom she had traveled, she stood beside the track with Mrs.
Hastings, a man whom she supposed to be Mr. Hastings,
Winifred and Wyllard about her. Another man also was
standing close by, apparently waiting until they noticed
him. He was covered with mire, his skin coat was very
dilapidated, and Agatha thought that his boots never had
been cleaned. His hair, which had evidently been badly
cut, straggled out from under his old fur cap.
</p>
<p>Gregory apparently explained something to Mrs. Hastings.
&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it can&#8217;t be for another
week. Horribly unfortunate. It seems they&#8217;ve sent the
Methodist on down the line, and we&#8217;ll have to wait for the
Episcopalian. He&#8217;ll be at Lander&#8217;s for a few days.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s cheeks flamed, for she realized that it was her
wedding of which they were speaking; but it brought her
a curious relief to hear that it had been deferred. A moment
or two later Gregory turned to her with questions
about his people in England.
</p>
<p>Winifred had separated herself from the group. She
was standing near her baggage, which had been flung out
beside the track, when Wyllard strode up to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Feeling rather out of it? I do, any way,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Since we appear superfluous, we may as well
make the most of the opportunity, especially as it will
probably save you a long drive. There&#8217;s a man here who
wants to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred had felt forlorn a few moments earlier, but
the announcement Wyllard made was reassuring, and she
brightened perceptibly as he signaled to a man who was
standing a little further along the track. The stranger wore
rather good store clothes, and his manner was brisk and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
wholly business-like. It was a certain relief to the girl to
see that he evidently regarded her less as a personality than
as a piece of commercial machinery, of which apparently
he had been asked to make use. She had found it easier
to get on with men who looked upon her as merely part of
the office equipment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hamilton is in charge of the elevator yonder,&#8221; explained
Wyllard, pointing to one of the huge buildings.
</p>
<p>Then he introduced Miss Rawlinson.
</p>
<p>The elevator man made her the curtest of bows and proceeded
to arrange matters with a rapidity which almost
took her breath away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Typist and stenographer?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Know anything
about keeping accounts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred admitted that she possessed these qualifications
and Hamilton appeared to reflect for a moment or
two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in a fortnight we&#8217;ll give you a show.
You can start at&mdash;&#8221; and he mentioned terms which
rather astonished Winifred. &#8220;If you can keep things
straight we may raise you later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you want to see any testimonials?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Hamilton. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a good many
and I&#8217;m inclined to believe some of the folks who showed
them to me must have bought them.&#8221; He waved his hand.
&#8220;Mr. Wyllard assures me that you&#8217;ll do, and that&#8217;s quite
enough for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It struck Winifred as curious that, while Agatha had
written to Hawtrey on her behalf, it was Wyllard who had
secured her the opportunity for which she had longed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another matter,&#8221; she said hesitatingly, when
she was left with Wyllard, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to live here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen to that, though if you don&#8217;t
like my arrangements you can alter them afterwards. Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Sandberg will take you in. She&#8217;s a Scotch Calvinist, and
even if she isn&#8217;t particularly amiable you&#8217;ll be in safe
hands. We&#8217;ll consider it as fixed, but you&#8217;re to stay with
Mrs. Hastings for a fortnight. Sproatly&#8221;&mdash;he signed to
the man in the skin coat&mdash;&#8220;will you get Miss Rawlinson&#8217;s
baggage into your wagon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man took off his fur cap. &#8220;If Miss Rawlinson
would like to see Mrs. Sandberg, I&#8217;ll drive her round,&#8221; he
suggested. &#8220;We&#8217;ll catch you in a league or so. Gregory
has a bit of patching to do on his off-side trace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have had things straight for once,&#8221; grumbled
Wyllard half-aloud.
</p>
<p>Winifred permitted Sproatly to help her into his
wagon&mdash;a high, narrow-bodied vehicle, mounted on tall,
spidery wheels&mdash;but she had to hold fast to the seat while
they jolted across the track and through a sea of mire into
the unpaved street of the little town. She liked Sproatly&#8217;s
voice and manner, though she was far from prepossessed
by his appearance. Two or three minutes later he stopped
before a little wooden house, where they were received by
a tall, hard-faced woman, who frowned at the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll tak&#8217; your patent medicines somewhere else. I&#8217;m
wanting none,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Sproatly grinned. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid of them.
They couldn&#8217;t hurt you. I was talking to a Winnipeg doctor
who&#8217;d a notion of coming out a day or two ago. I
told him if he did he&#8217;d have to bring an ax along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he explained that Wyllard had sent Miss Rawlinson
there, and the woman favored her with a glance of
careful scrutiny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Weel,&#8221; she said, &#8220;ye look quiet, anyway.&#8221; She added,
as if further satisfied, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make ye a cup of tea if ye can
wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly assured her that they had not time to accept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
her hospitality. The girl went into the house for a few
moments and returned to the wagon with relief in her
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I owe Mr. Wyllard a good deal,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Sproatly laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re not exactly unusual in that
respect,&#8221; he declared as he started the horses. &#8220;But you
had better hold tight. These beasts are less than half
broken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flicked the horses with the whip, and they went
across the track at a gallop, hurling great clods of mud
left and right, while the group of loungers who still stood
about the station raised a shout.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got any little pictures with nice motters on them?&#8221;
asked one, and another flung a piece of information after
the jolting wagon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a Swede down at Branker&#8217;s wants a bottle that
will limber up a wooden leg,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Sproatly grinned, and waved his hands to them before
he turned to Winifred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to get through before dark, if possible, or
I&#8217;d stop and sell them something sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Parts
of the trail further on are simply horrible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It occurred to Winifred that the road was far from
good as it was, for spouts of mud flew up beneath the
sinking hoofs and wheels, and she was already unpleasantly
spattered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you would have succeeded making a sale?&#8221;
she asked with amusement in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Sproatly answered confidently. &#8220;If I
couldn&#8217;t plant something on to them when they&#8217;d given me
a lead like that, I&#8217;d be no use in this business. At present,
my command of Western phraseology is my fortune.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sell things, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly pointed to two big boxes in the bottom of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
wagon. &#8220;Anything from cough cure to hair restorer,
besides a general purpose elixir that&#8217;s specially prepared
for me. It&#8217;s adaptable to any complaint and season. All
you have to do&#8221;&mdash;and he lowered his voice confidently&mdash;&#8220;is
to put on a different label.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred laughed when she met his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens to the people who buy it?&#8221; she inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of them are bachelors, and tough. They&#8217;ve stood
their own cooking so long that they ought to be impervious
to anything, and if anybody&#8217;s really sick I hold off
and tell him to wait until he can get a doctor. A sensitive
conscience,&#8221; he added reflectively, &#8220;is quite a handicap
in this business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have always been in it?&#8221; asked Winifred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Sproatly, &#8220;although you mightn&#8217;t believe
it, I was raised with the idea that I should have my choice
between the Church and the Bar. The idea, however,
proved&mdash;impracticable&mdash;which is rather a pity. It has
seemed to me that a man who can work off cough cures
and cosmetics on to healthy folks and talk a scoffer off
the field, ought to have made his mark in either calling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at her as if for confirmation of this view, but
Winifred, who laughed again, glanced at the two wagons
that, several miles away, moved across the gray-white sweep
of prairie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we overtake them?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll probably come up with Gregory. I&#8217;m not sure
about Wyllard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He drives faster horses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not quite the reason. Gregory has patched up
one trace with a bit of string, and odd bolts are rather
addicted to coming out of his wagon. Sometimes it
makes trouble. I&#8217;ve known the team to leave him sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
on the prairie, thinking of endearing names for them,
while they came home with the pole.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he generally let things fall into that state?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly was evidently on his guard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;it&#8217;s certainly that kind of
wagon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flicked the team again, and the jolting rendered it
difficult for Winifred to ask any more questions. The
prairie sod was soft with the thaw, and big lumps of it
stuck to the wheels, which every now and then plunged
into ruts the other vehicles had made.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Agatha and Hawtrey had found it
almost impossible to sustain a conversation. It was a relief
to the girl to be able to sit silent and observant beside
the man whom she had promised to marry. The string-patched
trace still held, and the wagon pole was a new
one. The white grass was tussocky and long, and the trail
here and there had been churned into quagmire. Hawtrey
had packed the thick driving-robe high about Agatha
and had slipped one arm about her waist beneath it; but
she was conscious that she rather suffered this than derived
any satisfaction from it. She strove to assure herself that
she was jaded with the journey, which was, in fact, the
case, and that the lowering sky, and the cheerless waste
they were crossing, had occasioned the dejection that she
felt. There was not a tree upon the vast sweep of bleached
grass which ran all around her to the horizon. It was
inexpressibly lonely, a lifeless desolation, with only the
plowed-up trail to show that man had ever traversed it.
The raw wind which came across the prairie set her shivering.
</p>
<p>She was forced, however, to admit that her weariness
and the dreary surroundings did not quite explain everything.
Gregory&#8217;s first embrace had brought her no happiness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
and now the close pressure of his arm left her quite
unmoved. This was disconcerting; but while she would
admit no definite reason for it, there was creeping upon
her a vague consciousness that the man beside her was
not the one of whom she had so often thought in England.
He seemed different&mdash;almost, in fact, a stranger&mdash;though
she could not exactly tell where the change in him began.
His laughter jarred upon her. Some of the things he said
appeared almost inane, and others were tinged with a self-confidence
that did not become him. It seemed to her
that he was shallow and lacking in comprehension. Once
she found herself comparing him with another man. She
broke off that train of thought abruptly, and once more
endeavored to find the explanation in herself. Weariness
had produced this captious, hypercritical fit, and by and
by she would become used to him, she said.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey was, at least, not effusive, for which she was
thankful. When they reached a smoother stretch of road
he began to talk of England.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you saw a good deal of my folks when you
were at the Grange,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Agatha, &#8220;I saw them once or twice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he replied, with a trace of sharpness, &#8220;then they
were not particularly agreeable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed to Agatha that he was tactless in suggesting
anything of the kind, but she replied candidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One could hardly go quite so far as that,&#8221; she told him.
&#8220;Still, I couldn&#8217;t help a feeling that it was rather an effort
for them to be gracious to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They did what they could to make things pleasant
when they were first told of our engagement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was too weary to be altogether on her guard.
His relatives&#8217; attitude had wounded her, and she answered
without reflection.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have fancied that was because they never quite believed
it would lead to anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She knew this was the truth now, though it was the first
time the explanation had occurred to her. Gregory&#8217;s relatives,
who were naturally acquainted with his character,
had not expected him to carry out his promise. She felt
that she had been injudicious in what she told him when
she heard his harsh laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they never had a very great opinion of
me,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Agatha, looking up at him, &#8220;it will be
our business to prove them wrong; but I can&#8217;t help feeling
that you have undertaken a big responsibility, Gregory.
There must be so much that I ought to do, and I know so
little about your work in this country.&#8221; She turned, and
glanced with a shiver at the dim, white prairie. &#8220;The
land looks so forbidding and unyielding. It must be very
hard to turn it into wheat fields&mdash;to break it in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was merely a hint of what she felt, and it was rather
a pity that Hawtrey, who lacked imagination, usually contented
himself with the most obvious meaning of the
spoken word. Things might have gone differently had he
responded with comprehending sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, with a laugh that changed her mood,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll learn, and I don&#8217;t suppose it will matter a great
deal if you don&#8217;t do it quickly. Somehow or other one
worries through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt that this was insufficient, though she remembered
that his haphazard carelessness had once appealed
to her. Now she realized that to undertake a thing light-heartedly
was a very different matter from carrying it
out successfully. Then it once more occurred to her that
she was becoming absurdly hypercritical, and she strove to
talk of other things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>She did not find it easy, nor, though he made the effort,
did Hawtrey. There was a restraint upon him, for when
he first saw her he had been struck by the change in the
girl. She was graver than he remembered her, and, it
seemed, very much more reserved. He had tried and
failed, as he thought of it, to strike any response in her.
He became uneasily conscious that he could not talk to her
as he could to Sally Creighton. There was something
wanting in him or her, but he could not at the moment
tell what it was. Still, he assured himself, things would
be different next day, for the girl was evidently very tired.
</p>
<p>The creeping dusk settled down upon the wilderness.
The horizon narrowed, and the stretch of grass before
them grew dim. The trail they now drove into grew rapidly
rougher, and it was quite dark when they came to the
brink of a declivity still at least a league from the Hastings
homestead. It was one of the steep ravines that
seam the prairie. A birch bluff rose on either side, and a
little creek flowed through the hollow.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey swung the whip when they reached the top,
and the team plunged furiously down the slope. He
straightened himself in his seat with both hands on the
reins, and Agatha held her breath when she felt the light
vehicle tilt as the wheels on one side sank deep in a rut.
Something seemed to crack, and she saw the off horse
stumble and plunge. The other horse flung its head up,
Hawtrey shouted something, and there was a great smashing
and snapping of undergrowth and fallen branches as
they drove in among the birches. The team stopped, and
Hawtrey, who sprang down, floundered noisily among the
undergrowth, while another thud of hoofs and rattle of
wheels grew louder behind them up the trail. In a minute
or two Hawtrey came back and lifted Agatha down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the trace broken. I had to make the holes with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
my knife, and the string&#8217;s torn through,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Voltigeur got it round his feet, and, as usual, tried to
bolt. We&#8217;ll make the others pull up and take you in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went back to the trail together, and reached it just
as Hastings reined in his team. Hastings got down and
walked back with Hawtrey to the stalled wagon. It was
a minute or two before they reappeared again, and Mrs.
Hastings, who had alighted, drew Hawtrey aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost think it would be better if you didn&#8217;t come
any further to-night,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Gregory asked sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help thinking that Agatha would prefer it.
For one thing, she&#8217;s rather jaded, and wants quiet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel sure of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was something in the man&#8217;s voice which suggested
that he was not quite satisfied, and Mrs. Hastings was
silent a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good advice, Gregory,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be better
able to face the situation after a night&#8217;s rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it require much facing?&#8221; Hawtrey asked dryly.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings turned from him with a sign of impatience.
&#8220;Of course it does. Anyway, if you&#8217;re wise you&#8217;ll
do what I suggest, and ask no more questions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she got into the wagon, and Hawtrey stood still
beside the trail, feeling unusually thoughtful as they drove
away.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AGATHA&#8217;S DECISION</h3>
</div>

<p>It was with an expectancy which was toned down by misgivings
that Hawtrey drove over to the homestead where
Agatha was staying the next afternoon. The misgivings
were not unnatural, for he had been chilled by the girl&#8217;s
reception of him on the previous day, and her manner
afterwards had, he felt, left something to be desired. Indeed,
when she drove away with Mrs. Hastings, he had considered
himself an injured man.
</p>
<p>His efforts to mend the harness, and extricate the
wagon in the dark, which occupied him for an hour, had
helped partly to drive the matter from his mind, and when
he reached his homestead rather late that night he went
to sleep, and slept soundly until sunrise. Hawtrey was a
man who never brooded over his troubles beforehand, and
this was one reason why he did not always cope with them
successfully when they could no longer be avoided.
</p>
<p>When he had eaten his breakfast, however, he became
sensible of a certain pique against both Mrs. Hastings and
Agatha. In planning for the day he was forced to remember
that he had no hired man, and that there was a good
deal to be done. He decided that it might be well to wait
until the afternoon before he called on Agatha, and for
several hours he drove his team through the crackling
stubble. His doubts and irritation grew weaker as he
worked, and when, later, he drove into sight of the Hastings
homestead, his buoyant temperament was beginning
to reassert itself. Clear sunshine streamed down upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the prairie out of a vault of cloudless blue, and he felt
that any faint shadow that might have arisen between
him and the girl could be readily swept away. He was a
little less sure of this when he saw Agatha, who sat near
an open window, in a scantily furnished match-boarded
room. She had not slept at all. Her eyes were heavy,
but there was a look of resolution in them which seemed
out of place just then, and it struck him that she had
lost the freshness which had been her distinguishing
charm in England.
</p>
<p>She rose when he came in, and then, to his astonishment,
drew back a pace or two when he moved impulsively towards
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, with a hand raised restrainingly, &#8220;you
must hear what I have to say, and try to bear with me.
It is a little difficult, Gregory, but it must be said at
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregory stood still, gazing at her with consternation in
his face, and for a moment she looked steadily at him.
It was a painful moment, for she was gifted with a clearness
of vision which she almost longed to be delivered
from. She saw that the impression which had brought
her a vague sense of dismay on the previous afternoon was
wrong. The trouble was that he had not changed at all.
He was what he had always been, and she had merely deceived
herself when she had permitted her girlish fancy to
endow him with qualities and graces which he had never
possessed. There was, however, no doubt that she had
still a duty toward him.
</p>
<p>He spoke first with a trace of hardness in his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;won&#8217;t you sit down? This is
naturally a little&mdash;embarrassing&mdash;but I&#8217;ll try to listen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sank into a seat by the open window, for she felt
physically worn out, and before her there was a task from
which she shrank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory,&#8221; she began, &#8220;I feel that we have come near
making what might prove to be a horrible mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; repeated Hawtrey, while the blood rose into his
weather-darkened face. &#8220;That means both of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; asserted Agatha, with a steadiness that cost her
an effort.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey went a step nearer to her. &#8220;Do you want me
to admit that I&#8217;ve made a mistake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure you haven&#8217;t?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She flung the question at him sharply with tense apprehension,
for, after all, if Gregory was sure of himself,
there was only one course open to her. He leaned upon
the table, gazing at her, and as he studied her face his indignation
melted, and doubts crept into his mind.
</p>
<p>She looked weary, and grave, almost haggard, and it
was a fresh, light-hearted girl with whom he had fallen in
love in England. The mark of the last two years of struggle
was plain on her. He tried to realize what he had
looked for when he had asked her to marry him, and could
not get a clear conception of his vision. In the back of
his mind was a half-formulated idea that he had dreamed
of a cheerful companion, somebody to amuse him. She
scarcely seemed likely to be entertaining now.
</p>
<p>Gregory was not a man who could face a crisis collectedly,
and his thoughts became confused until one idea
emerged from them. He had pledged himself to her, and
the fact laid a certain obligation upon him. It was his
part to overrule any fancies she might be disposed to indulge
in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said stoutly, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to admit anything
of that kind. The journey has been too much for
you. You haven&#8217;t got over it yet.&#8221; He lowered his voice,
and his face softened. &#8220;Aggy, dear, I&#8217;ve waited four
years for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His words stirred her, for they were certainly true, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
his gentleness had also its effect. The situation was becoming
more and more difficult, since it seemed impossible
to make him understand that he would in all probability
speedily tire of her. To make it clear that she could
never be satisfied with him was a thing from which she
shrank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How have you passed those four years?&#8221; she asked,
to gain time.
</p>
<p>For a moment his conscience smote him. He remembered
the trips to Winnipeg, and the dances to which he
had escorted Sally Creighton. It was, however, evident
that Agatha could have heard nothing of Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent them in hard work. I wanted to make the
place comfortable for you,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;It is true&#8221;&mdash;and
he added this with a twinge of uneasiness, as he
remembered that his neighbors had done much more with
less incentive&mdash;&#8220;that it&#8217;s still very far from what I would
like, but things have been against me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The speech had a far stronger effect than he could have
expected, for Agatha remembered Wyllard&#8217;s description of
what the prairie farmer had to face. Those four years of
determined effort and patient endurance, as she pictured
them, counted heavily against her in the man&#8217;s favor.
It flashed upon her that, after all, there might have been
some warrant for the view that she had held of Gregory&#8217;s
character when he had fallen in love with her. He was
younger then. There must have been latent possibilities
in him, but the years of toil had killed them and hardened
him. It was for her sake he had made the struggle, and
now it seemed unthinkable that she should renounce him
because he came to her with the dust and stain of it upon
him. For all that, she was possessed with a feeling that
she would involve them both in disaster if she yielded.
Something warned her that she must stand firm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I seem to know that we should
both be sorry afterwards if I kept my promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey straightened himself with a smile that she recognized.
She had liked him for it once, for it had then
suggested the joyous courage of untainted youth. Now,
however, it struck her as merely hinting at empty, complacent
assurance. She hated herself for the fancy, but it
would not be driven away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m quite willing to face that
hazard. I suppose this diffidence is only natural, Aggy,
but it&#8217;s a little hard on me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the girl with emphasis, &#8220;it&#8217;s horribly unnatural,
and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m afraid. I should have come
to you gladly, without a misgiving, feeling that nothing
could hurt me if I was with you. I wanted to do that,
Gregory&mdash;I meant to&mdash;but I can&#8217;t.&#8221; Then her voice fell
to a tone that had vibrant regret in it. &#8220;You should have
made sure&mdash;you should have married me when you last
came home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d nowhere to take you. The farm was only
half-broken prairie, the homestead almost unhabitable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha winced at this. It was, no doubt, true, but it
seemed horribly petty and commonplace. His comprehension
stopped at such details as these, and he had given her
no credit for the courage which would have made light
of bodily discomfort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that would have mattered? We
were both very young then, and we could have faced our
troubles and grown up together. Now we&#8217;re not the same.
You let me grow up alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t changed,&#8221;
he told her as she looked at him with deep-seeing eyes.
</p>
<p>He contented himself with that, and Agatha grew more
resolute. There was not a spark of imagination in him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
scarcely even a spark of the passion which, if it had been
strong enough, might have swept her away in spite of her
shrinking. He was a man of comely presence, whimsical,
and quick, as she remembered, at light badinage, but when
there was a crisis to be grappled with he somehow failed.
His graces were on the surface. There was no depth in
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aggy,&#8221; he added humbly, when he should have been
dominant and forceful, &#8220;it is only a question of a little
time. You will get used to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; pleaded the girl, who clutched at the chance of
respite, &#8220;give me six months from to-day. It isn&#8217;t very
much to ask, Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregory wrinkled his brows. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal,&#8221; he
answered slowly. &#8220;I feel that we shall drift further and
further apart if once I let you go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you feel that we have drifted a little already?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what has come over you, Aggy, but there
has been a change. I&#8217;m what I was, and I want to keep
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha rose and turned towards him a white face. &#8220;If
you are wise you will not urge me now,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey met her gaze for a moment, and then made a
sign of acquiescence as he turned his eyes away. He recognized
that this was a new Agatha, one whose will was
stronger than his. Yet he was astonished that he had
yielded so readily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;if it must be, I can only give way
to you, but I must be free to come over here whenever I
wish.&#8221; Suddenly a thought struck him. &#8220;But you may
hare to go away,&#8221; he added, with sudden concern. &#8220;If I
am to wait six months, what are you to do in the meanwhile?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled wearily. Now that the respite had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
granted her, the question he had raised was not one that
caused her any great concern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;we can think of that later. I
have borne enough to-day. This has been a little hard
upon me, Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it has been particularly easy for either of
us,&#8221; returned Hawtrey, with grimness. &#8220;Anyway, it
seems that I&#8217;m only distressing you.&#8221; There was a baffled,
puzzled look in his face. &#8220;Naturally, this is so unexpected
that I don&#8217;t know what to say. I&#8217;ll come back
when I feel I&#8217;ve grasped the situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Taking one of her hands, he stooped and kissed her
cheek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I only want to make it as easy as
I can. You&#8217;ll try to think of me favorably.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out and left her sitting beside the open window.
A warm breeze swept into the room; outside a blaze
of sunshine rested on the prairie. The ground about the
house was torn up with wheel ruts, for the wooden building
rose abruptly without fence or garden from the waste
of whitened grass. Close to the house stood a birch-log
barn or stables, its sides curiously ridged and furrowed
where the trunks were laid on one another. Further away
rose a long building of sod, and a great shapeless yellow
mound with a domed top towered behind it. It was most
unlike a trim English rick, and Agatha wondered what it
could be. As a matter of fact, it was a not uncommon
form of granary, the straw from the last thrashing flung
over a birch-pole framing. Behind it ran a great breadth
of knee-high stubble, blazing ocher and cadmium in the
sunlight. It had evidently extended further than it did,
for a blackened space showed where a fire had been lighted
to destroy it. In the big field Hastings was plowing.
Clad in blue duck he plodded behind his horses, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
stopped now and then when the share jarred against a
patch of still frozen soil. Further on two other men, silhouetted
in blue against the whitened grass, drove spans
of slowly moving oxen that hauled big breaker plows,
and the lines of clods that lengthened behind them gleamed
in the sunlight a rich chocolate-brown. Beyond them the
wilderness ran unbroken to the horizon.
</p>
<p>Agatha gazed at it all vacantly, but the newness and
strangeness of it reacted upon her. She felt very desolate
and lonely, but she remembered that she must still
grapple with a practical difficulty. She could not stay
with Mrs. Hastings indefinitely, and she had not the least
notion where to go or what she was to do. She was leaning
back in her chair wearily with half-closed eyes when
her hostess came in and looked at her with a smile that
suggested comprehension. Mrs. Hastings was thin, and
seemed a trifle worn, but she had shrewd, kindly eyes.
She wore a plain print dress which was dusted here and
there with flour.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have sent him away!&#8221; she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>It was borne in upon Agatha that she could be candid
with this woman who had already guessed the truth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;for six months. That is, we are
not to decide on anything until they have passed. I felt
we must get used to each other. It seemed best.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To you. Did it seem best to Gregory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flush crept into Agatha&#8217;s face. Though his acquiescence
had been a relief to her, she felt that he might have
made a more vigorous protest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave in to me,&#8221; she answered.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings looked thoughtful. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she observed,
&#8220;I believe you were wise, but that opens up another
question. What are you going to do in the meanwhile?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed Agatha apathetically. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
suppose I shall have to go away&mdash;to Winnipeg, most probably.
I could teach, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you and Gregory to get used to each other if
you go away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha made a helpless gesture. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t looked at it
in that light.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you very anxious to get used to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha shrank from the question; but there was a constraining
kindliness in the older woman&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I daren&#8217;t quite think about it yet. I mean to try. I
must try. I seem to be playing an utterly contemptible,
selfish part, but I could not marry him&mdash;now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings crossed the room, and sat down by her
side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;as I told you, I think you are
doing right, and I believe I know how you feel. Everybody
prophesied disaster when I came out to join Allen
from a sheltered home in Montreal, and at the beginning
my life here was not easy to me. It was all so different,
and there were times when I was afraid, and my heart was
horribly heavy. If it hadn&#8217;t been for Allen I think I
should have given in and broken down. He understood,
however. He never failed me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s eyes grew misty, and she turned her head away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;that would make it wonderfully
easier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must forgive me,&#8221; apologized Mrs. Hastings.
&#8220;I was tactless, but I didn&#8217;t mean to hurt you. Well,
one difficulty shouldn&#8217;t give us very much trouble. Why
shouldn&#8217;t you stay here with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha turned towards her abruptly with a look of relief
in her face, which faded quickly. She liked this woman,
and she liked her husband, but she remembered that she
had no claim on them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;it is out of the question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a little. I&#8217;m proposing to give you quite as much
as you will probably care to do. There are my two little
girls to teach, and I think they have rather taken to you.
I can scarcely find a minute for their lessons, and, as you
have seen, there is a piano which has only a few of the keys
broken. Besides, we have only one Scandinavian maid
who smashes everything that isn&#8217;t made of indurated fiber,
and I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;ll marry one of the boys in a month or
two. It was only by sending the kiddies to Brandon and
getting Mrs. Creighton, a neighbor of ours, to look after
Allen, who insisted on my going, that I was able to get to
Paris with some Montreal friends. In any case, you&#8217;d
have no end of duties.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are doing this out of&mdash;charity!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings laughed. &#8220;A week or two ago, Allen
wrote to some friends of his in Winnipeg asking them to
send me anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes shone mistily. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you
have lifted one weight off my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; observed Mrs. Hastings, &#8220;the others will
also be removed in due time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that she talked cheerfully of other matters, and
Agatha listened to her with a vague wonder at her own
good fortune in falling in with such a friend.
</p>
<p>There are in that country many men and women who are
unfettered by conventions. They stretch out an open hand
to the stranger and the outcast. Toil has brought them
charity in place of hardness, and still retaining, as some of
them do, the culture of the cities, they have outgrown all
the petty bonds of caste. The wheat-grower and the hired-man
eat together. Rights are good-humoredly conceded
in place of being fought for, and the sense of grievance
and half-veiled suspicion common elsewhere among employes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
are exchanged for an efficient co-operation. It
must, however, be admitted that there are also farmers of
another kind, from whom the hired man has occasionally
some difficulty in extracting his covenanted wages by personal
violence.
</p>
<p>The two women had been talking a long time when a
team and a jolting wagon swept into sight, and Mrs.
Hastings rose as the man who drove pulled up his horses.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Sproatly; I wonder what has brought him here,&#8221;
she remarked.
</p>
<p>The man sprang down from the wagon and walked
towards the house. She gazed at him almost incredulously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s quite smart,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see a single
patch on that jacket, and he has positively got his hair
cut.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that an unusual thing in Mr. Sproatly&#8217;s case?&#8221;
Agatha inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings. &#8220;It&#8217;s very unusual indeed.
What is stranger still, he has taken the old grease-spotted
band off his hat, after clinging to it affectionately for the
last twelve months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha thought that the soft hat, which fell shapelessly
over part of Sproatly&#8217;s face, needed something to replace
the discarded band; but in another moment he entered the
room. He shook hands with them both.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are looking remarkably fresh, but appearances are
not invariably to be depended on, and it&#8217;s advisable to keep
the system up to par,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;I suppose
you don&#8217;t want a tonic of any kind?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Mrs. Hastings resolutely; &#8220;Allen
doesn&#8217;t, either. Besides, didn&#8217;t you get into some trouble
over that tonic?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the cough cure,&#8221; explained Sproatly with a grin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
&#8220;I sold a man at Lander&#8217;s one of the large-sized bottles,
and when he had taken some he felt a good deal better.
Then he seems to have argued the thing out like this:
if one dose had relieved the cough, a dozen should drive
it out of him altogether, and he took the lot. He slept for
forty-eight hours afterward, and when I came across him
at the settlement he attacked me with a club. The fault,
I may point out, was in his logic. Perhaps you would like
some pictures. I&#8217;ve a rather striking oleograph of the
Kaiser. It must be like him, for two of his subjects recognized
it. One hung it up in his shanty; the other asked
me to hold it out, and then pitched a stove billet through
the middle of it. He, however, produced his dollar; he
said he felt so much better after what he&#8217;d done that he
didn&#8217;t grudge it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re not worth powder and shot,&#8221; said Mrs.
Hastings. &#8220;Do you ever remember our buying any tonics
or pictures from you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, though I have felt that you ought to have
done it.&#8221; Sproatly, who paused a moment, turned towards
Agatha with a little whimsical bow. &#8220;The professional
badinage of an unlicensed dealer in patent medicines may
now and then mercifully cover a good deal of embarrassment.
Miss Ismay has brought something pleasantly characteristic
of the Old Country along with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His hostess disregarded the last remark. &#8220;Then if you
didn&#8217;t expect to sell us anything, what did you come for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For supper,&#8221; answered Sproatly cheerfully. &#8220;Besides
that, to take Miss Rawlinson out for a drive. I told her
last night it would afford me considerable pleasure to show
her the prairie. We could go round by Lander&#8217;s and
back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will probably come across her somewhere
about the straw-pile with the kiddies.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Sproatly took the hint, and when he went out Mrs. Hastings
laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You would hardly suppose that was a young man of
excellent education!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;So it&#8217;s on Winifred&#8217;s
account he has driven over; at first I fancied it was
on yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was astonished, but she smiled. &#8220;If Winifred
favors him with her views about young men he will probably
be rather sorry for himself. He lives near you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings. &#8220;In the summer he lives
in his wagon, or under it, I don&#8217;t know which. Of
course, if he&#8217;s really taken with Winifred he will have to
alter that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he has only seen her once&mdash;you can&#8217;t mean that
he is serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t speak for Sproatly, but it would be quite
in keeping with the customs of the country if he was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A minute or two later Agatha saw Winifred in the
wagon when it reappeared from behind the straw-pile, and
Mrs. Hastings turned toward the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has gone with him,&#8221; she commented significantly.
&#8220;Unfortunately, he has taken my kiddies too. If he
brings them back with no bones broken it will be a relief
to me.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>WANDERERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Agatha had spent a month with Mrs. Hastings. When
they were driving over to Wyllard&#8217;s homestead one afternoon,
the older woman pulled up her team while they were
still some little distance away from their destination, and
looked about her with evident interest. On the one hand,
a vast breadth of torn-up loam ran back across the prairie,
which was now faintly flecked with green. On the other,
plowing teams were scattered here and there across the
tussocky sod, and long lines of clods that flashed where the
sunlight struck their facets trailed out behind them. The
great sweep of grasses that rustled joyously before a glorious
warm wind, gleamed luminously, and overhead hung
a vault of blue without a cloud in it. Trailing out across
it, flocks of birds moved up from the south.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry is sowing a very big crop this year, and most of
it on fall back-set,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;He has, however,
horses enough to do that kind of thing, and, of course, he
does it thoroughly.&#8221; She glanced toward the place where
the teams were hauling unusually heavy plows through
the grassy sod. &#8220;This is virgin prairie that he&#8217;s breaking,
and he&#8217;ll probably put oats on it. They ripen quicker.
He ought to be a rich man after harvest unless the frost
comes, or the market goes against him. Some of his
neighbors, including my husband, would have sown a little
less and held a reserve in hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha remembered what Wyllard had told her one
night on board the <i>Scarrowmania</i>, and smiled, for she fancied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
that she understood the man. He was not one to
hedge, as she had heard it called, or cautiously hold his
hand. He staked boldly, but she felt that this was not
only for the sake of the money that he might hope to gain.
It was part of his nature&mdash;the result of an optimistic faith
or courage that appealed to her, and sheer love of effort.
She also guessed that his was not a spasmodic, impulsive
activity. She could imagine him holding on as steadfastly
with everything against him, exacting all that men and
teams and machines could do. It struck her as curious
that she should feel so sure of this; but she admitted that
it was the case.
</p>
<p>Sitting in the driving-seat of a big machine that ripped
broad furrows through the crackling sod, he was approaching
them. Four horses plodded wearily in front of the
giant plow until he thrust one hand over, and there was
a rattle and clanking as he swung them and the machine
around beside the wagon. Then he got down, and stood
smiling up at Agatha with his soft hat in his hand and the
sunlight falling full upon his weather-darkened face. It
was not a particularly striking face, but there was something
in it, a hint of restrained force and steadfastness,
she thought, which Gregory&#8217;s did not possess, and for a
moment or two she watched him covertly.
</p>
<p>He wore an old blue shirt, open at the throat and belted
into trousers of blue duck, and she noticed the fine symmetry
of his spare figure. The absence of any superfluous
flesh struck her as in keeping with her view of his character.
The man was well-endowed physically; but apart
from the strong vitality that was expressed in every line of
his pose he looked clean, as she vaguely described it to herself.
There was an indefinable something about him that
was apparently born of a simple, healthful life spent in determined
labor in the open air. It became plainer, as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
remembered other men upon whom the mark of the beast
was unmistakably set. Mrs. Hastings broke the silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we have driven over as we promised.
I&#8217;ve no doubt you will give us supper, but we&#8217;ll go on and
sit with Mrs. Nansen in the meanwhile. I expect you&#8217;re
too busy to talk to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed, and it occurred to Agatha that his
laugh was wholesome as well as pleasant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I generally am busy,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;These horses
have been at it since sun-up, and they&#8217;re rather played out
now. I&#8217;ll talk to you as long as you will let me after supper,
which will soon be ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha noticed that though the near horse&#8217;s coat was
foul with dust and sweat he laid his brown hand upon it,
and it seemed to her that the gentleness with which he did
it was very suggestive.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings, who had been scrutinizing the field,
asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s to be the result of all this plowing if we
have harvest frost or the market goes against you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a big deficit,&#8221; answered Wyllard cheerfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that doesn&#8217;t cause you any anxiety?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have had some amusement for my money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings turned to Agatha. &#8220;He calls working
from sunrise until it&#8217;s dark, and afterwards now and then,
amusement!&#8221; She looked back at Wyllard. &#8220;I believe
it isn&#8217;t quite easy for you to hold your back as straight as
you are doing, and that off-horse certainly looks as if it
wanted to lie down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed. &#8220;It won&#8217;t until after supper, anyway.
There are two more rows of furrows still to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that is a hint!&#8221; Mrs. Hastings glanced at
Agatha when the wagon jolted on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is a great favorite of mine.
For one thing, he&#8217;s fastidious, though he&#8217;s fortunately very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
far from perfect in some respects. He has a red-hot temper,
which now and then runs away with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by fastidious?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little difficult to define, but I certainly don&#8217;t
mean pernicketty. Of course, there is a fastidiousness
which makes one shrink from unpleasant things, but
Harry&#8217;s is the other kind. It impels him to do them
every now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha made no answer. She was uneasily conscious
that it might not be advisable to think too much about this
man, and in another minute or two they reached the homestead.
The house was a plain frame building that had
grown out of an older and smaller one of logs, part of
which remained. It was much the same with the barns
and stables, for, while they were stoutly built of framed
timber or logs, one end of most of them was lower than
the rest, and in some cases consisted of poles and sods.
Even to her untrained eyes all she saw suggested order,
neatness, and efficiency. The whole was flanked and sheltered
by a big birch bluff, in which trunks and branches
showed through a thin green haze of tiny opening leaves.
</p>
<p>A man whom Wyllard had sent after them took the
horses.
</p>
<p>Agatha commented on what she called the added-to look
of the buildings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Range,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings, &#8220;has grown rapidly
since Harry took hold. The old part represents the high-water
mark of his father&#8217;s efforts. Of course,&#8221; she added
reflectively, &#8220;Harry has had command of some capital
since a relative of his died, but I never thought that explained
everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They entered the house, and a gray-haired Swedish woman
led them through several match-boarded rooms into a
big, cool hall. She left them there for a while, and Agatha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
was absorbed for a minute or two with her impressions of
the house. It was singularly empty by comparison with the
few English homesteads that she had seen. There were
no curtains nor carpets nor hangings of any kind, but it
was commodious and comfortable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What can a bachelor want with a place like this?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Mrs. Hastings; &#8220;perhaps it&#8217;s
Harry&#8217;s idea of having everything proportionate. The
Range is quite a big, and generally a prosperous, farm.
Besides, it&#8217;s likely that he doesn&#8217;t contemplate remaining
a bachelor forever. Indeed, Allen and I sometimes wonder
how he has escaped marriage for so long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is &#8216;escaped&#8217; the right word?&#8221; Agatha asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; asserted Mrs. Hastings with a laugh. &#8220;You
see, he&#8217;s highly eligible from our point of view, but at the
same time he&#8217;s apparently invulnerable. I believe,&#8221; she
added dryly, &#8220;that&#8217;s the right word, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Swedish housekeeper appeared again and they
talked with her until she went to bring in the six o&#8217;clock
supper. Soon after the table was laid Wyllard and the
men came in. Wyllard was attired as when Agatha had
last seen him, except that he had put on a coat. He led
his guests to the head of the long table, but the men&mdash;there
were a number of them&mdash;sat below, and evidently
had no diffidence about addressing question or comment
to their employer.
</p>
<p>The men ate with a voracious haste, but that appeared
to be the custom of the country, and Agatha could find
no great fault with their manners or conversation. The
talk was, for the most part, quaintly witty, and some of
the men used what struck her as remarkably fitting and
original similes. Indeed, as the meal proceeded, she became
curiously interested.
</p>
<p>The windows were open wide, and a sweet, warm air
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
swept into the barely furnished room. The spaciousness
of the room impressed her, and she was pleased with the
evident unity of these brown-faced, strong-armed toilers
with their leader. At the head of the table he sat, self-contained,
but courteous and responsive to all alike, and
though they were in an essentially democratic country,
she felt that there was something almost feudal in the
relations between him and his men. She could not imagine
them to be confined to the mere exaction of so much
labor and the expectation of payment of wages due. She
was pleased that he had not changed his clothing.
</p>
<p>So strong was Agatha&#8217;s interest that she was surprised
when the meal was finished. Afterward, she and Mrs.
Hastings talked with the housekeeper for a while, and an
hour had slipped away when Wyllard suggested that he
should show her the slough beyond the bluff.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the nearest approach to a lake we have until you
get to the alkali tract,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Agatha went with him through the shadow of the wood,
and when they came out among the trees he found her a
seat upon a fallen birch. The house and plowing were
hidden now, and they were alone on the slope to a slight
hollow, in which half a mile of gleaming water lay. Its
surface was broken here and there by tussocks of grass and
reeds, and beyond it the prairie ran back unbroken, a dim
gray waste, to the horizon. The sun had dipped behind
the bluff, and the sky had become a vast green transparency.
There was no wind now, but a wonderful exhilarating
freshness crept into the cooling air, and the
stillness was broken only by the clamor of startled wildfowl
which Agatha could see paddling in clusters about
the gleaming slough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are ducks&mdash;wild ones?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Wyllard; &#8220;ducks of various kinds.
Most of them the same as your English ones.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you shoot them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was not greatly interested, but he seemed disposed
to silence, and she felt, for no very clear reason, that
it was advisable to talk of something.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not often, anyway. If Mrs. Nansen
wants a couple I crawl down to the long grass with the
rifle and get them for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The rifle? Doesn&#8217;t the big bullet destroy them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Wyllard. &#8220;You have to shoot their
head off or cut their neck in two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do that&mdash;when they&#8217;re right out in the
slough?&#8221; asked Agatha, who had learned that it is much
more difficult to shoot with a rifle than a shotgun, which
spreads its charge.
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;Generally; that is, if I haven&#8217;t
been doing much just before. It depends upon one&#8217;s
hands. We have our game laws, but as a rule nobody
worries about them, and, anyway, those birds won&#8217;t nest
until they reach the tundra by the Polar Sea. Still, as
I said, we never shoot them unless Mrs. Nansen wants
one or two for the pot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite know. For one thing, they&#8217;re worn out;
they just stop here to rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His answer appealed to the girl. It did not seem
strange to her that the love of the lower creation should
be strong in this man, who had no hesitation in admitting
that the game laws were no restraint to him. When these
Lesser Brethren, worn with their journey, sailed down out
of the blue heavens, he believed in giving them right of
sanctuary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They have come a long way?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Wyllard pointed towards the south. &#8220;From Florida,
Cuba, Yucatan; further than that, perhaps. In a day or
two they&#8217;ll push on again toward the Pole, and others will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
take their places. There&#8217;s a further detachment arriving
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Looking up, Agatha saw a straggling wedge of birds
dotted in dusky specks against the vault of transcendental
blue. The wedge coalesced, drew out again, and dropped
swiftly, and the air was filled with the rush of wings; then
there was a harsh crying and splashing, and she heard the
troubled water lap among the reeds until deep silence
closed in upon the slough again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The migrating instinct is strangely interesting,&#8221; she
said.
</p>
<p>A curious look crept into Wyllard&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives the poor birds a sad destiny, I think; they&#8217;re
wanderers and strangers without a habitation; there&#8217;s unrest
in them. After a few months on the tundra mosses to
gather strength and teach the young to fly, they&#8217;ll unfold
their wings to beat another passage before the icy gales.
Some of us, I think, are like them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha could not avoid the personal application.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely don&#8217;t apply that to yourself,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You certainly have a habitation&mdash;the finest, isn&#8217;t it,
on this part of the prairie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Wyllard slowly; &#8220;I suppose it is.
I&#8217;ve now had a little rest and quietness too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His last remark did not appear to call for an answer,
and Agatha sat silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; he went on reflectively, &#8220;I have a feeling that
some day the call will come, and I shall have to take the
trail again.&#8221; He paused, and looked at her before he
added, &#8220;It would be easier if one hadn&#8217;t to go alone,
or, since that would be necessary, if one had at least
something to come back to when the journey was
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Must you heed the call?&#8221; asked Agatha, who was
puzzled by his steady gaze.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said with gravity, &#8220;the call will come from
the icy North if it ever comes at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was another brief silence. Agatha wondered
what he was thinking of, but he soon told her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember how I came back from there last time,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We were rather late that season, and out of our
usual beat when the gale broke upon us in the gateway
of the Pole, between Alaska and Asia. We ran before it
with a strip of the boom-foresail on one vessel and a jib
that blew to ribands every now and then. The schooner
was small, ninety tons or so, and for a week she scudded
with the gray seas tumbling after her, white-topped, out
of the snow and spume. The waves ranged high above her
taffrail, curling horribly, but one did not want to look at
them. The one man on deck had a line about him, and
he looked ahead, watching the vessel screwing round with
hove-up bows as she climbed the seas. If he&#8217;d let her fall
off or claw up, the next wave would have made an end of
her. He was knee-deep half the time in icy brine, and
his hands had split and opened with the frost, but the
sweat dripped from him as he clung to the jarring wheel.
The helmsmen had another trouble which preyed on them.
They were thinking of the three men they had left behind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we ran out of the gale, and I had
bitter words to face when we reached Vancouver. As one
result of the trouble I walked out of the city with four
or five dollars in my pocket&mdash;though there was a share due
to me. Then in an open car I rode up into the ranges to
mend railroad bridges in the frost and snow. It was not
the kind of home-coming one would care to look forward
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Agatha cried with a shudder, &#8220;it must have
been horribly dreary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man met her eyes. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&mdash;know.
You came here from far away, I think a little weary, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
and something failed you. Then you felt yourself adrift.
There were&mdash;it seemed&mdash;only strangers around you, but
you were wrong in one respect; you were by no means a
stranger to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had been leaning against a birch trunk, but now he
moved a little nearer, and stood gravely looking down on
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have sent Gregory away?&#8221; he questioned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Agatha, and, startled, as she was, it
did not occur to her that the mere admission was misleading.
</p>
<p>Wyllard stretched out his hands. &#8220;Then won&#8217;t you
come to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The blood swept into the girl&#8217;s face. For the moment
she forgot Gregory, and was conscious only of an unreasoning
impulse which prompted her to take the hands
held out to her. She rose and faced Wyllard with burning
cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know nothing of me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can you think
that I would let you take me out of charity?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Again you&#8217;re wrong&mdash;on both points. As I once told
you, I have sat for hours beside the fire beneath the pines
or among the boulders with your picture for company.
When I was worn out and despondent you encouraged me.
You have been with me high up in the snow on the
ranges, and through leagues of shadowy bush. That is
not all. There were times when, as we drove the branch
line up the gorge beneath the big divide, all one&#8217;s nature
shrank from the monotony of brutal labor. The paydays
came around, and opportunities were made for us to
forget what we had borne, and had still to bear. Then
you laid a restraining hand on me. I could not take
your picture where you could not go. Is all that to count
for nothing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held out his arms to her. &#8220;As to the other question,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
can you get beyond the narrow point of view? We&#8217;re in
a big, new country where the old barriers are down. We&#8217;re
merely flesh and blood&mdash;red blood&mdash;and we speak as we
feel. Admitting that I was sorry for you&mdash;I am&mdash;how
does that tell against me&mdash;or you? There&#8217;s one thing only
that counts at all&mdash;I want you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was stirred with an emotion that made her
heart beat wildly. He had spoken with a force and passion
that had nearly swept her away with it. The vigor
of the new land throbbed in his voice, and, flinging aside
all cramping restraints and conventions, he had claimed
her as primitive man claimed primitive woman. Her
whole being responded to his love and Gregory faded out
of her mind; but there was, after all, pride in her, and
she could not quite bring herself to look at life from
his point of view. All her prejudices and her traditions
were opposed to it. He had made a mistake when he had
admitted that he was sorry for her. She did not want
his compassion, and she shrank from the thought that she
would marry him&mdash;for shelter. It brought to her a
sudden, shameful confusion as she remembered the haste
with which marriages were arranged on the prairie. Then,
as the first unreasoning impulse which had almost compelled
her to yield to him passed away, she reflected that
it was scarcely two months since she had met him in
England. It was intolerable that he should think that she
would be willing to fall into his arms merely because he
had held them out to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a little difficult to get beyond one&#8217;s sense of what
is fit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&mdash;I must say again&mdash;can&#8217;t know
anything about me. You have woven fancies about that
photograph, but you must recognize that I&#8217;m not the girl
you have created out of your reveries. In all probability
she is wholly unreal, unnatural, visionary.&#8221; Agatha contrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
to smile, for she was recovering her composure.
&#8220;Perhaps it is easy when one has imagination to endow
a person with qualities and graces that could never belong
to them. It must be easy&#8221;&mdash;though she was unconscious
of it, there was a trace of bitterness in her voice&mdash;&#8220;because
I know I could do it myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the man held out his arms. &#8220;Then,&#8221; he said
simply, &#8220;won&#8217;t you try? If you can only feel sure that
the person has the qualities you admire it is possible that
he could acquire one or two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha drew back. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve changed ever so much
since that photograph was taken!&#8221; she exclaimed with a
catch in her voice.
</p>
<p>Wyllard admitted it. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I recognized
that; you were a little immature then. I know that now&mdash;but
all the graciousness and sweetness in you has grown
and ripened. What is more, you have grown just as I
seemed to know you would. I saw that clearly the day we
met beside the stepping-stones. I would have asked you to
marry me in England, only Gregory stood in the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The color ebbed suddenly out of the girl&#8217;s face as she
remembered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory,&#8221; she declared in a strained voice, &#8220;stands
in the way still. I didn&#8217;t send him away altogether. I&#8217;m
not sure I made that clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard stood very still for a moment or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if there&#8217;s anything significant
in the fact that you gave me that reason last. He failed
you in some way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I haven&#8217;t failed him; but I can&#8217;t
go into that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Wyllard stood silent. Then he turned to her with
a strong restraint in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory is a friend of mine,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
least, one very good reason why I should remember it,
but it seems that somehow he hadn&#8217;t the wit to keep you.
Well, I can only wait, but when the time seems ripe I
shall ask you again. Until then you have my promise
that I will not say another word that could distress you.
Perhaps I had better take you back to Mrs. Hastings
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha turned away, and they walked back together
silently.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE SUMMONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Hastings was standing beside her wagon in the
gathering dusk when Agatha and Wyllard joined her.
After Wyllard had helped the two women into the vehicle
she looked down at him severely as she gathered up the
reins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By this time Allen will have had to put the kiddies
to bed,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Christina, as you might have borne in
mind, goes over to Branstock&#8217;s every evening. Anyway,
you&#8217;ll drive across and see him about that team as soon
as you can; come to supper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; promised Wyllard with a certain hesitation.
Mrs. Hastings turned to Agatha as they drove away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did he look at you before he answered me?&#8221; she
asked, and laughed, for there was just light enough left
to show the color in the girl&#8217;s cheek. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she added,
&#8220;I told Allen he was sure to be the first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment, but she
nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;of course, I knew it would
come. Everybody knows by now that you have fallen out
with Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as I told you, I haven&#8217;t fallen out with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly haven&#8217;t married him, and if you have
said &#8216;No&#8217; to Harry Wyllard because you would sooner
take Gregory after all, you&#8217;re a singularly unwise young
woman. Anyway, you&#8217;ll have to meet Harry when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
comes to supper. Allen&#8217;s fond of a talk with him; I
can&#8217;t have him kept away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a little afraid of that,&#8221; replied Agatha slowly.
&#8220;What makes the situation more difficult is that he told
me he would ask me again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings was thoughtful for a moment. &#8220;In that
case he will in all probability do it; but I don&#8217;t think you
need feel diffident about meeting him, especially as you
can&#8217;t help it. He&#8217;ll wait and say nothing until he considers
it advisable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She changed the subject, and talked about other matters
until they reached the homestead.
</p>
<p>As the weeks went by Agatha found that what Mrs.
Hastings had told her was warranted. Wyllard drove over
every now and then, but she was reassured by his attitude.
He greeted her with the quiet cordiality which had
hitherto characterized him, and it went a long way towards
allaying the embarrassment of which she was conscious at
first. By and by, however, she felt no embarrassment at
all, in spite of the disturbing possibility that he might at
some future time once more adopt the role of lover.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, she realized that despite the efforts
she made to think of him tenderly she was drifting further
apart from Gregory. She had two other offers of
marriage before the wheat had shot up a hand&#8217;s breadth
above the rich black loam. This was a matter of regret
to her, and, though Mrs. Hastings assured her that the
&#8220;boys&#8221; would get over it, she was rather shocked to hear
that one of them had shortly afterwards involved himself
in difficulties by creating a disturbance in Winnipeg.
</p>
<p>The wheat, however, was growing tall when, at Mrs.
Hastings&#8217; request, Agatha drove over to Willow Range.
Wyllard was out when they reached the homestead, and
leaving Mrs. Hastings and his housekeeper together, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
girl wandered out into the open air. She went through
the birch bluff and towards the slough, which had almost
dried up now, and it was with a curious stirring of confused
feelings that she remembered what Wyllard had said
to her there. Through all her thoughts ran a regret that
she had not met him four years earlier.
</p>
<p>Regrets, however, were useless, and in order to get rid
of them she walked more briskly up a low rise of ground
where the grass was already turning white again, over the
crest of the hill, and down the side to another hollow. The
prairie rolled in wide undulations as the sea does when the
swell of a distant gale underruns a glassy calm. Agatha
had grown fond of the prairie. Its clear skies and fresh
breezes had brought the color to her cheeks and given her
composure, though there were times when the knowledge
that she was no nearer a decision in regard to Gregory
weighed heavily upon her. She had seen very little of him
and he had not been effusive then. She could not guess
what his feelings might be, but it had been a relief to her
when he had ridden away from the home of the Hastingses.
For a while after she saw him he faded to an unsubstantial,
shadowy figure in the back of her mind.
</p>
<p>On this afternoon when Agatha tried to put out of her
mind the disturbing reflections that came to her as she
walked, the prairie stretched away before her, gleaming in
the sunlight under a vast sweep of cloudless blue. She was
half-way down the long slope when a clash and tinkle
reached her, and she noticed that a cloud of dust hung
about the hollow where there had been another slough,
which evidently had dried up weeks before. As men and
horses were moving amid the dust she supposed that they
were cutting prairie hay, which grows longer in such places
than it does upon the levels. She went on another half-mile,
and then sat down, for she had walked farther than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
she had intended to go. She could now see the men more
clearly, and, though it was fiercely hot, they were evidently
working at high pressure. Their blue duck clothing
and bare brown arms appeared among the white and
ocher tinting of the grass that seemed charged with brightness,
and the sounds of their activity came up to her. She
could distinguish the clashing tinkle of the mowers, the
crackle of the harsh stems, and the rattle of wagon
wheels.
</p>
<p>A great mound of gleaming grass, overhanging two half-seen
horses, moved out of the slough, and she watched it
draw nearer until she made out Wyllard sitting in the
front of it. She sat still until he pulled the team up close
beside her and looked down with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost two miles to the homestead. If you could
manage to climb up I could make you a comfortable
place,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Agatha held her hands up with one foot upon a spoke
of the wheels as Wyllard leaned down, and next moment
she was lifted upwards. She felt his supporting hand
upon her waist. Then she found herself standing upon a
narrow ledge, clutching at the hay while he tore out several
big armfuls of it and flung it back upon the top of the
load.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;THE NEXT MOMENT SHE WAS LIFTED UPWARDS&#8221; <i>Page</i> 146
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll find that a snug
enough nest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sank into it with a sense of physical satisfaction.
The grass was soft and warm; it was scented with the aromatic
odors of wild peppermint, and it yielded like a
downy cushion beneath her limbs. Still, she was just a
little uneasy in mind, for she fancied that she had seen a
sudden sign of feeling in Wyllard&#8217;s face when he had
held her for a moment on the ledge of the wagon. She
glanced at him and was reassured. He was looking
straight before him with unwavering eyes, and his face was
set and quiet. Neither of them spoke until the team
moved on. Then he turned to her.
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be jolted much,&#8221; he assured her. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
been at it since four o&#8217;clock this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; replied Agatha, &#8220;must mean that you rose at
three.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;As a matter of fact, it was half-past
two. There was no dew last night, and we started
early. I&#8217;ve several extra teams this year, and there&#8217;s a
good deal of hay to cut. Of course, we have to get it in
the sloughs or any damp place where it&#8217;s long. We
don&#8217;t sow grass, and we have no meadows like those
there are in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha understood that he meant to talk about matters
of no particular consequence, as he usually did. She had
noticed a vein of poetic imagination in him, and his idea
that she had been with him through the snow of the lonely
ranges and the gloom of the great forests of the Pacific
slope appealed to her. Since the day when he told her
that he loved her he had spoken only of commonplace subjects.
Sitting close beside him in the hay she decided to
let him talk about his farm, while she listened half-absently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have a foreman who could see the teams
turned out, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked, going back to the
subject of his early rising.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had, but he left me three or four days ago. It&#8217;s a
pity, since I&#8217;ve taken up rather more than I can handle
this year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you keep him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Martial was a little mulish, and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m
troubled with a shortness of temper now and then. We
had a difference of opinion as to the best way to drive the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
mower into the slough, and he didn&#8217;t seem to recognize
that he should have deferred to me. Unfortunately, as
the boys were standing by, I had to insist upon his getting
out of the saddle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had turned a little further towards her, and Agatha
noticed that there was a bruise upon one side of his face.
After what he had just told her the sight of it jarred upon
her, though she would not admit that there was any reason
why it should. She could not deny that on the prairie
a resort to physical force might be warranted by the lack
of any other remedy, but it hurt her to think of him as
descending to an open brawl with one of his men.
</p>
<p>Then it occurred to her that the other man in all probability
had suffered more, and this brought her a certain
sense of satisfaction which she admitted was more or less
barbarous. She had made it clear that Wyllard was nothing
to her, but she could not help watching him as he lay
back against the hay. His wide hat set off his bronzed
face, which, though not exactly handsome, was pleasant
and reassuring. The dusty shirt and old blue trousers accentuated
the long, clean lines of his figure, and she realized
with a faint sense of anger that his mere physical perfection,
his strength and suppleness, stirred her heart.
She recognized a feeling to be judiciously checked. After
all, in spite of her denial of it, she was endowed with power
to love as women close to nature love, with an emotion all-encompassing
and not subject to cold reasoning.
</p>
<p>They talked of trifles of no great consequence, for both
of them were conscious of the necessity for a certain reticence;
and when they reached the homestead Agatha joined
Mrs. Hastings, while Wyllard pitched the hay off the
wagon. He came in to supper presently with about half of
his men, and they all sat down together in the long, barely
furnished room. Wyllard was unusually animated. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
drew Mrs. Hastings into a bout of whimsical badinage,
which was interrupted when a beat of hoofs rose from the
prairie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s riding in; I wonder what he wants,&#8221; remarked
Wyllard. &#8220;I certainly don&#8217;t expect anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The drumming of hoofs rang more sharply through the
open windows, for the sod was hard and dry. It stopped
suddenly and Agatha saw Wyllard start as a man came
into the room. He was a little, thick-set man with a
seamed and tanned face. He was dressed in rather old
blue serge, and he walked as if he were a seaman.
</p>
<p>The stranger stood still, looking about him, and Wyllard&#8217;s
lips set tight. A thrill of apprehension ran through
Agatha, for she felt that she knew what this stranger&#8217;s
errand must be.
</p>
<p>Wyllard rose and walked towards the man with outstretched
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit right down and have some supper. You&#8217;ll want it
if you have ridden in from the railroad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
talk afterwards.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;m from Vancouver,&#8221; he announced,
&#8220;had quite a lot of trouble tracing you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat down, and Wyllard, who sent a man out to take
the newcomer&#8217;s horse, went back to his seat, but he was
very quiet during the remainder of the meal. When supper
was finished he asked Mrs. Hastings to excuse him, and
leading the stranger into a smaller room, pulled out two
chairs and laid a cigar on the table.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you can get ahead,&#8221; he said laconically.
</p>
<p>The seaman fumbled in his pocket, and taking out a
slip of wood handed it to his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I came to bring you,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s eyes grew grave as he gazed at the thing. It
was a slip of willow which grows close up to the limits of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
eternal ice, and it bore a rude representation of the British
ensign union down, which signifies &#8220;In distress.&#8221; Besides
this there were one or two indecipherable words scratched
on it, and three common names rather more clearly cut.
Wyllard recognized every one of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get it?&#8221; he asked, in tense suspense.
</p>
<p>The seaman once more felt in his pocket and took out a
piece of paper cut from a chart. He flattened the paper
out on the table, and it showed, as Wyllard had expected,
a strip of the Kamtchatkan coast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I needn&#8217;t tell you where that is,&#8221; the seaman
said, as he pointed to the parallel of latitude that ran
across it. &#8220;Dunton gave it to me. He was up there late
last season well over on the western side. A northeasterly
gale fell on them, and took most of the foremast out of
their ship. I understand they tried to lash on a boom or
something as a jury mast, but it hadn&#8217;t height enough to
set much forward canvas, and that being the case she
wouldn&#8217;t bear more than a three-reefed mainsail. Anyway,
they couldn&#8217;t do anything with her on the wind, and
as it kept heading them from the east she sidled away
down south through the Kuriles into the Yellow Sea.
They got ice-bound somewhere, which explains why Dunton
fetched Vancouver only a week ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the message?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When they were in the thick of their troubles they
hove to not far off the icy beach, and a Husky came down
on them in some kind of boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Husky?&#8221; repeated Wyllard, who knew the seaman
meant an Esquimau.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Dunton called him, but I guess he must
have been a Kamtchadale or a Koriak. Anyway, he
brought this strip of willow, and he had Tom Lewson&#8217;s
watch. Dunton traded him something for it. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
couldn&#8217;t make much of what he said except that he&#8217;d got
the message from three white men somewhere along the
beach. They couldn&#8217;t make out how long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunton tried for them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could he? His vessel would hardly look at the
wind, and the ice was piling up on the coast close to lee
of him. He hung on a week or two with the floes driving
in all the while, and then it freshened hard and blew him
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger had told his story, and Wyllard, who rose
with a quick gesture of deep anxiety, stood leaning on his
chairback. His face was grave.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;must have been eight or nine months
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was. They&#8217;ve been up there since the night we
couldn&#8217;t pick up the boat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unthinkable,&#8221; declared Wyllard. &#8220;The thing
can&#8217;t be true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The seaman gravely produced a little common metal
watch made in Connecticut, and worth five or six dollars.
Opening it, he pointed to a name scratched inside it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get over that,&#8221; he said simply.
</p>
<p>Wyllard strode up and down the room. When he sat
down again with a clenched hand laid upon the table he
and the seaman looked at each other steadily for a moment
or two. Then the stranger made a significant gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent them,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what are you going to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sailor smiled. &#8220;I knew it would be that. You&#8217;ll
have to start right away if it&#8217;s to be done this year. I&#8217;ve
my eye upon a schooner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He lighted a cigar, and settled himself more comfortably
in his chair. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m going with
you, but you&#8217;ll have to buy my ticket to Vancouver. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
cleaned me out to get here. We&#8217;d a difficulty with a blame
gunboat last season, and the boss went back on me. Sealing&#8217;s
not what is used to be. Anyway, we can fix the thing
up later. I won&#8217;t keep you from your friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard left the sailor and though he did not find Mrs.
Hastings immediately, he came upon Agatha sitting outside
the house. She glanced at his face when he sat down beside
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have had the summons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard nodded. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;that man was
the skipper of a schooner I once sailed in. He has come
to tell me where those three men are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He told her what he had heard, and the girl was
conscious of mingled admiration and fear, the fear of losing
him from her everyday life.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going up there to search for them?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it cost you a great deal?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw his face harden as he gazed at the tall wheat,
but his expression was resolute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;that&#8217;s a sure thing. Most of my
money is locked up in this crop, and there&#8217;s need of constant
watchfulness and effort until the last bushel&#8217;s hauled
in to the elevators. It probably sounds egotistical, but now
I&#8217;ve got rid of Martial I can&#8217;t put my hand on any one as
fit to see the thing through as I am. Still, I have to go
without delay. What else could I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t the Provincial Government of British Columbia
or your authorities at Ottawa take the matter
up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard shook his head. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be wise to give
them an opportunity. For one thing, they&#8217;ve had enough
of sealing cases, and that isn&#8217;t astonishing. We&#8217;ll say they
applied for the persons of three British subjects who are
supposed to be living somewhere in Russian Asia&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
for that matter I couldn&#8217;t be sure that two of them aren&#8217;t
Americans&mdash;the Russians naturally inquire what the men
were doing there. The answer is that they were poaching
for the Russians&#8217; seals. Then the affair on the beach
comes up, and there&#8217;s a big claim for compensation and
trouble all round. It seems to me the last thing those
men&mdash;they&#8217;re practically outlaws&mdash;would desire would be
to have a Russian expedition sent up on their trail. They
would want to lie hidden until they could somehow get off
again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how have they lived up there? The whole land
is frozen, isn&#8217;t it, most of the year?&#8221; she questioned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They had sealing rifles, and the Koriaks make out farther
north in their roofed-in pits. One can live on seal
and walrus meat and blubber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha shivered. &#8220;But they had no tents, nor furs, nor
blankets. It&#8217;s horrible to imagine it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Wyllard gravely; &#8220;that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going
for them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat still a moment. She could realize the magnitude
of the sacrifice that he was making, and in some degree
the hazards that he must face. It appealed to her
with an overwhelming force, but she was also conscious of
a strange dismay. She turned to him with a flush of
color in her cheeks and her eyes shining.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s splendid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled. &#8220;What could I do?&#8221; he said, &#8220;I sent
them.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>AGATHA PROVES OBDURATE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was two days later when Agatha, coming back from a
stroll across the prairie with the two little girls, found
Mrs. Hastings awaiting her at the homestead door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the kiddies. Harry Wyllard&#8217;s here, and he
seems quite anxious to see you, though I don&#8217;t know what
he wants,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>She flashed a searching glance at the girl, whose face,
however, remained impassive. It was not often that
Agatha&#8217;s composure broke down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait,&#8221; she added, &#8220;you had better go in this
minute. Allen has been arguing with him the last half-hour,
and can&#8217;t get any sense into him. It seems to me
the man&#8217;s crazy; but he might, perhaps, listen to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that is scarcely likely,&#8221; replied Agatha.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings made a sign of impatience. &#8220;Then,&#8221; she
rejoined, &#8220;it&#8217;s a pity. Anyway, if he speaks to you about
his project you can tell him that it&#8217;s altogether unreasonable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She drew aside, and Agatha walked into the room in
which she had had her painful interview with Gregory.
Wyllard, who rose as she came in, stood quietly watching
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nellie Hastings or her husband has been telling you
what they think of my idea?&#8221; he said questioningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Agatha answered. &#8220;Their opinion evidently
hasn&#8217;t much weight with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you a message for me?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You
were sent to denounce my folly&mdash;and you can&#8217;t do it. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
you trusted your own impulses you would give me your
benediction instead.&#8221; He smiled down at her.
</p>
<p>Agatha, who was troubled with a sense of regret, saw
a suggestive wistfulness in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t denounce your folly, as
they call your decision to go North. For one reason, I
have no right of any kind to force my views on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You told Mrs. Hastings that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed an unwarranted question, but the girl admitted
the truth frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In one sense I did. I suggested that there was no
reason why you should listen to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled again. &#8220;Nellie and her husband are
good friends of mine, but sometimes our friends are a little
too officious. Anyway, it doesn&#8217;t count. If you had had
that right, you would have told me to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha felt the warm blood rise to her cheeks. It
seemed to her that he had paid her a great and sincere
compliment in taking it for granted that if she had loved
him she would still have bidden him undertake his perilous
duty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps I should not
have been brave enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was not a judicious answer. She realized that, but
she felt that she must speak with unhesitating candor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she added, &#8220;can you be quite sure that this
is your duty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard kept his eye on her. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t.
In fact, when I sit down to think I can see at least a dozen
reasons why it doesn&#8217;t concern me. In a case of this kind
that&#8217;s always easy. It&#8217;s just borne in upon me&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know how&mdash;that I have to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha crossed to the window and sat down. He leaned
upon a chairback looking at her gravely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;we&#8217;ll go on a little further. It
seems better that I should make what&#8217;s in my mind quite
clear to you. You see, Captain Dampier and I start in a
week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was conscious of a shock of dismay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may be back before the winter, but it&#8217;s also quite
likely that we may be ice-nipped before our work is
through, and in that case it would be a year at least before
we reach Vancouver,&#8221; he went on steadily after a little
pause. &#8220;In fact, there&#8217;s a certain probability that all of
us may leave our bones up there. Now, there&#8217;s a thing I
must ask you. Is it only a passing trouble that stands between
you and Gregory? Are you still fond of him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s heart beat fast. It would have been a relief to
assure herself that she was as fond of Gregory as she had
been, but she could not do it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a point on which I cannot answer you,&#8221; she
declared in a voice that trembled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let it go at that. The fact that Gregory sent
me over for you implied a certain obligation. How far
events have cleared me of it I don&#8217;t know&mdash;and you don&#8217;t
seem willing to tell me. But I believe there is now less
cause than there was for me to thrust my own wishes into
the background, and, as I start in another week, the situation
has forced my hand. I can&#8217;t wait as I had meant to
do, and it would be a vast relief to know that I had made
your future safer than it is before I go. Will you marry
me at the settlement the morning I start?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half-conscious, as she was, of the unselfishness which
had prompted this suggestion, Agatha faced him in hot
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you suppose for a moment that I would agree to
that?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Try to look at it calmly. First
of all, I want you. You know that&mdash;though you have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
never shown me any tenderness, you can&#8217;t doubt it&mdash;but I
can&#8217;t stay to win your liking. I must go away. As things
stand, your future is uncertain; but as my wife it would,
at least, be safe. However badly the man I leave in charge
of the Range may manage there would be something saved
out of the wreck, and I would like to make that something
yours. As I said, I may be away a year, perhaps eighteen
months, and I may never come back. If I don&#8217;t return
the fact that you would bear my name could cause you no
great trouble. It would lay no restraint on you in any
way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked him in the eyes, and spoke with quick intensity.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t contemplate your not coming back.
It&#8217;s unthinkable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Wyllard, still with the grave quietness
she wondered at. &#8220;Then I&#8217;m not sure that my turning
up again would greatly complicate the situation. There
would, at least, be one way out of the difficulty. You
wouldn&#8217;t find your position intolerable if I could make you
fond of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha broke into a little, high-strung laugh that was
near to weeping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you taking too much for
granted? Am I really to believe you are making this fantastic
offer seriously? Do you suppose I would marry you&mdash;for
your possessions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My proposition does sound cold-blooded. Perhaps it
is in one way, but you wouldn&#8217;t always find me so practical
and calculating. Just now, because my hand is forced,
I am only anticipating things. If I live, you will some
day have to choose between Gregory and me. In that case
he must hold his own if he can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Against what you have offered me?&#8221; she flung the
question at him.
</p>
<p>He looked at her with his face set.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I expect I deserved that. I wanted to make you safe.
It&#8217;s the most pressing difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The resentment was still in the girl&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I am concerned, you seem to believe it is the
only difficulty. Oh, do you imagine that an offer of the
kind you have made me, made as you have made it, would
lead anyone to love you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard spoke with a new tenderness. &#8220;When I first
saw your picture, and when I saw you afterwards, I loved
your gracious quietness. Now you seem to have lost your
repose and I love you better as you are. There is one
thing, Agatha, that I must ask again, and it&#8217;s your duty to
tell me. Are you fonder of Gregory than you feel you
ever could be of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s eyes fell. She felt that she could not look at
him nor could she answer his question honestly as she desired
to answer it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least I am bound to him until he releases me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; responded Wyllard, &#8220;that is what I was most
afraid of. All along it hampered me, and in it you have
the reason for my cold, business-like talk to-day. It is another
reason why I should go away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For fear that you should tempt me from my duty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s expression changed, and there crept into his
eyes a gleam of the passion that he was smothering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I seem to know that I could make
you break faith with that man. You belong to me. For
three years you have been everywhere with me. Now I
must go away and Gregory will have a clear field, but the
probability is in favor of my coming back again, and then,
if he has failed to make the most of his chance, I&#8217;ll enforce
my claim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seized both her hands, holding them firmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my last word. At least, you will let me think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
that when I go up yonder into the mists and snow I shall
take your good wishes for my success away with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She lifted her flushed face, and once looked him steadily
in the eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My good wishes are yours, most fervently,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;It would be intolerable that you should fail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked sad as he let her hands fall. &#8220;After all,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;one can do only what one can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went away without another glance at her.
</p>
<p>Not long afterwards Mrs. Hastings, who was possessed
of a reasonable measure of curiosity, found occasion to
enter the room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have said something to trouble Harry?&#8221; she began.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure he&#8217;s greatly troubled. In any case, I
told him I would not marry him,&#8221; Agatha answered.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings gave her a glance of compassionate astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he&#8217;s mad. Did he tell you that he
means to leave Gregory in charge of Willow Range?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s face showed her surprise, but Mrs. Hastings
nodded reassuringly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; she asserted. &#8220;He
asked Gregory to meet him here to save time, and&#8221;&mdash;she
turned towards the window&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s his wagon now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She went to the door, and then turned again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any blood&mdash;red blood we will call it&mdash;or even
common-sense in you? You could have kept Harry here
if you had wanted to do so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Agatha, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I could. I&#8217;m
not even sure that, if I&#8217;d had the right, I would have done
it. He recognized that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings looked at her dubiously. &#8220;Then,&#8221; she
commented, &#8220;you have either a somewhat extraordinary
character, or you are in love with him in a way that is beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
most of us. In any case, I can&#8217;t help feeling that
you will be sorry some day for what you have done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Next moment the door closed with a bang, and Agatha
was left alone to analyze her sensations during her interview
with Wyllard. She found the task difficult, for her
memory of what had happened was confused and fragmentary.
She had certainly been angry with Wyllard.
It was humiliating that he had evidently taken it for
granted that the greater security she would enjoy as his
wife would have preponderance of weight with her, yet
there was a certain satisfaction in the reflection that to
leave her dependent upon Mrs. Hastings caused him concern.
For another thing, his reserve had been perplexing,
and it was borne in upon her that it would have cost her
a more determined effort to withstand him had he spoken
with fire and passion.
</p>
<p>If the man had been fervently in love with her, why had
he not insisted on that fact? she asked herself. Could it
have been because, with the fantastic generosity of which
he was evidently capable, he had been willing to leave his
friend unhandicapped with an open field? That seemed
too much to expect from any man. Then there was the
other explanation&mdash;that he preferred to leave the choice
wholly to her, lest he should tempt her too strongly to break
faith with Gregory. This idea brought the blood to her
face since it suggested that he believed that he had merely
to urge her sufficiently in order to make her yield. There
was, it seemed, no satisfactory explanation at all! The one
fact remained that he had made her a dispassionate offer
of marriage, and had left her to decide.
</p>
<p>Wyllard could not have made the matter very much
clearer. Shrewdly practical, as he was in some respects,
there were times when he acted blindly, merely doing without
reasoning what he felt sub-consciously was right. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
had more than once involved him in disaster, but in the
long run the failures of such men often prove better than
the dictates of calculating wisdom.
</p>
<p>Agatha found a momentary relief from her thoughts as
she watched Hawtrey get down from his wagon and approach
the house. The change in him was plainer than it
had ever been. It may have been because she had now a
standard of comparison that it was so apparent. He was
tall and well-favored, and he moved with a jaunty yet not
ungraceful swing; but it seemed to her that his bearing
was merely the result of an empty self-sufficiency. There
was, she felt, no force behind it. Gregory was smiling,
and there was certainly a hint of sensuality in his face
which suggested that the man might sink into a self-indulgent
coarseness. Agatha remembered that she was still
pledged to him and determinedly brushed these thoughts
aside.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey entered a room where, with a paper in his
hand, Wyllard sat awaiting him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you to drive over here because it would save
time,&#8221; said Wyllard. &#8220;I have to go in to the railroad at
once. Here&#8217;s a draft of the scheme I suggested. You had
better tell me if there&#8217;s anything you&#8217;re not quite satisfied
with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He threw the paper on the table, and Hawtrey took
it up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to farm and generally manage the Range on your
behalf,&#8221; said Hawtrey after reading its contents. &#8220;My
percentage to be deducted after harvest. I&#8217;m empowered
to sell out grain or horses as appears advisable, and to have
the use of teams and implements for my own place when
occasion requires it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked up. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no fault to find with the thing,
Harry. It&#8217;s generous.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better sign it, and we&#8217;ll get Hastings
to witness it in a minute or two. In the meanwhile there&#8217;s
a thing I have to ask you. How do you stand in regard to
Miss Ismay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey pushed his chair back noisily. &#8220;That,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;is a subject on which I&#8217;m naturally not disposed to
give you any information. How does it concern you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way. Believing that your engagement must
be broken off, I asked Miss Ismay to marry me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey was clearly startled, but in a moment or two
he smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she wouldn&#8217;t. As a matter of
fact, our engagement isn&#8217;t broken off. It&#8217;s merely extended.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other in silence for a moment
or two, and there was a curious hardness in Wyllard&#8217;s
eyes. Hawtrey spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of what you have just told me, why did you
want to put me, of all people, in charge of the Range?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be candid,&#8221; answered Wyllard. &#8220;For one thing,
you held on when I was slipping off the trestle that day
in British Columbia. For another, you&#8217;ll make nothing
of your own holding, and if you run the Range as it ought
to be run it will put a good many dollars into your pocket,
besides relieving me of a big anxiety. If you&#8217;re to marry
Miss Ismay, I&#8217;d sooner she was made reasonably comfortable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey looked up with a flush in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is extravagantly generous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; returned Wyllard; &#8220;there&#8217;s a little more to be
said. I can&#8217;t be back before the frost, and I may be away
eighteen months. While I am away you will have a clear
field&mdash;and you must make the most of it. If you are not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
married when I come back I shall ask Miss Ismay again.
Now&#8221;&mdash;and he glanced at his comrade steadily&mdash;&#8220;does
this stand in the way of you&#8217;re going on with the arrangement
we have arrived at?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a rather tense silence for a moment or two,
and then Hawtrey said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; after all there is no reason why it should do so.
It has no practical bearing upon the other question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard rose. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;if you will call
Allen Hastings in we&#8217;ll get this thing fixed up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The document was duly signed, and a few minutes later
Wyllard drove away.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings contrived to have a few words with Hawtrey
before he left the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt that Harry took you into his confidence
on a certain point,&#8221; she remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Hawtrey, &#8220;he did. I was a little
astonished, besides feeling rather sorry for him. There
is, however, reason to believe that he&#8217;ll soon get over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel sure of that?&#8221; Mrs. Hastings smiled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it evident? If he had cared much about her he
certainly wouldn&#8217;t have gone away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared Hawtrey, &#8220;there&#8217;s no doubt of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings smiled again. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she commented,
&#8220;I would like to think you were right about Harry; it
would be a relief to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey presently drove away, and soon after he left
the homestead Agatha approached Mrs. Hastings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I must ask you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Has
Gregory consented to take charge of Wyllard&#8217;s farm?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; answered Mrs. Hastings in her dryest tone.
</p>
<p>There was a flash in Agatha&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it&#8217;s almost unendurable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>Agatha saw Wyllard only once again, and that was when
he called early one morning. He got down from the
wagon where Dampier sat, and shook hands with her and
Allen and Mrs. Hastings. Few words were spoken, and
she could not remember what she said, but when he swung
himself up again and the wagon jolted away into the white
prairie she went back to the house with a feeling of loss
and depression.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE BEACH</h3>
</div>

<p>For a fortnight after they reached Vancouver Wyllard and
Dampier were very busy. They had various difficulties to
contend with, for while they would have preferred to slip
away to sea as quietly as possible a British vessel&#8217;s movements
are fenced about with many formalities, and they
did not wish to ship a white man who could be dispensed
with. Wyllard knew there were sailors and sealers in Vancouver
and down Puget Sound who would have gone with
him, but there was a certain probability of their discussing
their exploits afterwards in the saloons ashore, which
was about the last thing that he desired. It was essential
that he should avoid notoriety as much as possible.
</p>
<p>He had further trouble about obtaining provisions and
general necessaries, for considerably more attention than
the free-lance sealers cared about was being bestowed upon
the North, and he did not desire to arouse the curiosity of
the dealers as to why he was filling his lazaret up with
Arctic stores. He obviated that difficulty by dividing his
orders among all of them, and buying as little as possible.
Dampier proved an adept at the difficult business, and
eventually the schooner <i>Selache</i>, painted a pale green,
crept out from the Narrows, at dusk one evening, under
all plain sail, with her big main-boom making at least a
fathom beyond her taffrail. On board were Wyllard,
Dampier, and two other white men. A week later the
<i>Selache</i> sailed into a deep, rock-walled inlet on the western
coast of Vancouver Island. At the settlement the
storekeeper made no difficulty about selling Wyllard all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
his flour and canned goods at higher figures than there
was any probability of obtaining from the local ranchers.
</p>
<p>The <i>Selache</i> slid down the inlet again, and lay for several
days in a forest-shrouded arm near the mouth of it.
When she once more dropped her anchor off a Siwash
rancherie far up on the wild west coast, she was painted a
dingy gray, and her sawn-off boom just topped her stern.
One does not want a great main-boom in the northern seas,
and a big mainsail needs men to handle it. Wyllard, however,
shipped several sea-bred Indians who had made perilous
voyages on the trail of the seal and halibut in open
canoes. All of them had also sailed in sealing schooners.
Their comrades sold him furs, and filled part of the hold
with redwood billets and bark for the stove, for he had
not considered it advisable to load too much Wellington
coal.
</p>
<p>Wyllard pushed out into the waste Pacific, and once
when a beautiful big white mail boat reeled by him, driving
with streaming bows into an easterly gale, he sent back
a message to his friends upon the prairie. It duly reached
them, for three weeks afterward Allen Hastings, opening
<i>The Colonist</i>, which he had ordered from Victoria as soon
as Wyllard sailed, read to his wife and Agatha a paragraph
in the shipping news:
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Empress of India</i>, from Yokohama, reports having
passed small gray British schooner, flying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; There
followed several code letters, the latitude and longitude,
and a line apparently by the water-front reporter: &#8220;No
schooner belonging to this city allotted the signal in question.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings smiled as he laid down the paper. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
observed, &#8220;that signal is Wyllard&#8217;s private code. Agatha,
won&#8217;t you reach me down my map of the Pacific? It&#8217;s
just behind you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>As he looked around he noticed the significant expression
on his wife&#8217;s face, for the girl already had turned towards
the shelf where he kept the lately purchased map.
</p>
<p>The easterly gale that started did not last, for the wind
came out of the west and north, and sank to foggy calms
when it did not blow wickedly hard. This meant that the
<i>Selache&#8217;s</i> course was all to windward, and though they
drove her unmercifully under reefed book-foresail, main
trysail, and a streaming jib or two, with the brine going
over her, she had made little headway when each arduous
day was done. They were drenched to the skin continuously,
and lashed by stinging spray. Cooking except of
the crudest kind was out of the question, and sleep would
have been impossible to any but worn-out sailors. The
little crew was often aroused in the blackness of the night
to haul down a burst jib, to get in another reef, or to
crawl out on a plunging bowsprit washed by icy seas as
the schooner lay with her lee rail under. Glad as they
were of the respite it was even more trying to lie rolling
wildly on the big smooth waves that hove out of the windless
calm, while everything in the vessel banged to and fro.
When the breeze came screaming through the fog or rain
they sprang to make sail again.
</p>
<p>Fate seemed to oppose them, as it was certain that, if
their purpose was suspected, the hand of every white man
whom they might come across would be against them.
But they held on over leagues of empty ocean.
</p>
<p>The season wore away, and at last the wind freshened
easterly, and they ran for a week under boom-foresail and
a jib, with the big gray combers curling as they foamed by
high above her rail. Then the wind fell, and Dampier,
who got an observation, armed his deep-sea lead, and, finding
shells and shoal water, went aft to talk to Wyllard
with the strip of Dunton&#8217;s chart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>Wyllard, who was clad in oilskins, stood by the wheel.
His face was tanned and roughened by cold and stinging
brine. There was an open sore upon one of his elbows,
and both his wrists were raw. Forward, a white man and
two Siwash were standing about the windlass, and when
the bows went up a dreary stretch of slate-gray sea opened
beyond them, beneath the dripping jibs. The <i>Selache</i> was
carrying sail, and lurching over the steep swell at some
four knots an hour.
</p>
<p>Dampier stopped near the wheel, and glanced at Wyllard&#8217;s
oilskins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take them off. It&#8217;s stuffed boots and
those Indian seal-gut things or furs from now on,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That leather cuff&#8217;s chewing up your hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cut that out,&#8221; replied Wyllard; &#8220;it&#8217;s not to the
point. Can&#8217;t you get on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier grinned. &#8220;We&#8217;re on soundings, and they and
Dunton&#8217;s longitude &#8217;most agree. With this wind we should
pick the beach up in the next two days. Next question is,
where were those men?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221; corrected Wyllard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;ve pushed on it&#8217;s probably a different thing,
though, if they&#8217;d food yonder, I don&#8217;t quite see why they&#8217;d
want to push on anywhere. It wouldn&#8217;t be south, anyway.
They&#8217;d run up against the Russians there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve decided that already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m admitting it,&#8221; said the skipper. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
other choice that they&#8217;ve gone up north. It&#8217;s narrower
across to Alaska there, and it&#8217;s quite likely they might
have a notion of looking out for one of the steam whalers.
The Koriaks up yonder will have boats of some kind. If
the boats are skin ones like those the Huskies have they
might sledge them on the ice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a suggestion that had been made several times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
before, but both the men realized that there was in all
probability very little to warrant it. Wyllard had wasted
no time endeavoring to learn what was known about the
desolation on the western shore of the Behring Sea. He
had bought a schooner and set out at once. It appeared
almost impossible to him that any three men could haul
the skin boats and supplies they would need far over hummocky
ice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The point is that we&#8217;ll have to fix on some course in
the next few days,&#8221; added Dampier. &#8220;Say we run in to
make inquiries&#8221;&mdash;a gleam of grim amusement crept into
his eyes&mdash;&#8220;what are we going to find? A beach with a
roaring surf on it, and if we get a boat through, a desolate,
half-frozen swamp behind it. It&#8217;s quite likely there
are people in the country, Koriaks or Kamtchadales, but,
if there are, they&#8217;ll probably move up and down after what
they get to eat like the Huskies do, and we can&#8217;t hang on
and wait for them. &#8217;Most any time next month we&#8217;ll have
the ice closing in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made no reply for another minute, and, as he
stood with hands clenched on the wheel, a puff of bitter
spray splashed upon his oilskins. They had been over it all
often before, weighing conjecture after conjecture, and had
found nothing in any that might serve to guide them.
Now, when winter was close at hand, they had leagues of
surf-swept beach to search for three men who might have
perished twelve months earlier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stand in until we pick up the beach,&#8221; he said at
length. &#8220;Then if there&#8217;s no sign of them we&#8217;ll push north
as long as we can find open water. Now if you&#8217;ll call
Charly I&#8217;ll let up at the wheel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Another white man walked aft, and Wyllard, entering
the little stern cabin, the top of which rose several feet
above the deck, took off his wet oilskins and crawled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
dressed as he was, into his bunk. Evening was closing in,
and for a while he lay blinking at the swinging lamp, and
wondering what the end of the search would be.
</p>
<p>The <i>Selache</i> was a little fore and aft schooner of some
ninety-odd tons, wholly unprotected against ice-chafe or
nip, and he knew that prudence dictated their driving her
south under every rag of canvas now. There was, however,
the possibility of finding some sheltered inlet where
she could lie out the winter, frozen in, and he had blind
confidence in his crew. The white men were sealers who
had borne the lash of snow-laden gales, the wash of icy
seas, and tremendous labor at the oar, and the Indians
had been born to an unending struggle with the waters.
All of them had many times looked the King of Terrors
squarely in the face. As an encouraging aid to strenuous
effort they had been promised a tempting bonus if the <i>Selache</i>
returned home successful.
</p>
<p>While Wyllard pondered upon these things he went to
sleep and slept soundly, though Dampier expected to raise
the beach some time next morning. The skipper&#8217;s expectation
proved to be warranted, and, when Wyllard turned
out, the stretch of shore lay before them, a dingy smear
on a slate-green sea that was cut off from it by a wavy line
of vivid whiteness, which he knew to be a fringe of spouting
surf. It had cost Wyllard more than he cared to contemplate
to reach that beach, and now there was nothing in
the dreary spectacle that could excite any feeling, except a
shrinking from the physical effort of the search. There
was little light in the heavy sky or on the sullen heave of
sea; the air was raw, the schooner&#8217;s decks were sloppy, and
the vessel rolled viciously as she crept shorewards with her
mainsail peak eased down. What wind there was blew
dead on-shore, which was not as the skipper would have
had it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>Wyllard heard the splash of the lead as he and the white
man, Charly, ate their breakfast in the little stern cabin.
There was a clatter of blocks, and on going out on deck he
found the men swinging a boat over. With Charly and
two of the Indians he dropped into the boat, and Dampier,
who had hove the schooner to, looked down on them over
the vessel&#8217;s rail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you knock the bottom out of her put a jacket on an
oar, and I&#8217;ll try to bring you off,&#8221; he said, pointing toward
the boat. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t signal I&#8217;ll stand off and on with
a thimble-headed topsail over the mainsail. You&#8217;ll start
back right away if you see us haul it down. When she
won&#8217;t stand that there&#8217;ll be more surf than you&#8217;ll have any
use for with the wind dead on the beach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made a sign of comprehension, and they slid
away on the back of a long sea. Waves rolled up behind
them, cutting off the schooner&#8217;s hull so that only her gray
canvas showed above dim slopes of water. The beach rose
fast before them. It looked forbidding with the spray-haze
drifting over it, and the long wash of the Pacific weltering
among its hammered stones. When the men drew
a little nearer Wyllard stood up with the big sculling oar
in his hand. There was no point to offer shelter, and in
only one place could he see a strip of surf-lapped sand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little softer than the boulders, anyway; we&#8217;ll try
it there,&#8221; he ordered.
</p>
<p>The oars dipped again, and in another minute the sea
that came up behind them hove them high and broke into
a little spout of foam. The next wave had a hissing
crest, part of which splashed on board, and, like a toboggan
down an icy slide, the boat went shoreward on the
shoulders of the third. To keep her straight while the
water seethed about them was all that they could do. For
a moment their hearts were in their mouths when the wave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
left them to sink with a dizzy swing into the hollow of the
sea.
</p>
<p>They pulled desperately as another white-topped ridge
came on astern, and they went up with it amid a chaotic
frothing and splashing of spray. After that there was a
shock and a crash. They sprang out into the knee-deep
water and held fast to the boat while the foam boiled into
her. Before the next sea came in they had run the boat
up beyond its reach, and they discovered that there was
not much the matter with her when they hove her over.
Wyllard looked back at the tumbling surf.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dampier was right about that topsail; it won&#8217;t be quite
so easy getting off,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stand by,
Charly, and watch the schooner. If the surf gets steeper
you can make some sign. I&#8217;ll leave one of the Siwash on
the rise yonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he walked up the beach. On the crest of the low
rise a mile or two behind it, he stopped a while, gazing out
at what seemed to be an empty desolation. There were
willows in the hollow beneath him, and upon the slope a
few little stunted trees, which resembled the juniper that
he had seen among the ranges of British Columbia, but he
could see no sign of any kind of life. What was more portentous,
the mossy sod he stood upon was frozen, and there
were stretches of snow among the straggling firs upon a
higher ridge. Inland, the little breeze seemed to have
fallen dead away, and there was an oppressive silence
which the rumble of the surf accentuated.
</p>
<p>Wyllard left one of the Indians on the hill and going on
with the other scrambled through a half-frozen swamp in
the hollow; but when they came back hours afterwards as
the narrow horizon was drawing further in, they had found
nothing to show that any man had ever entered that grim,
silent land. The surf seemed a little smoother, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
reeled out through it with only a few inches of very cold
water splashing about their boots, and pulled across a long
stretch of darkening sea toward the rolling schooner.
</p>
<p>Wyllard was weary and depressed, but it was not until
he sat in the stern cabin with its cheerful twinkling stove
and swinging lamp that he understood how he had shrunk
from that forbidding wilderness. His consultation with
Dampier, who came in by and by, was brief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll head north for a couple of days, and try again,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>He crawled into his berth early, and it was some time
after midnight when he was awakened by being rudely
flung out of it. That fact, and the slant of deck and
sounds above, suggested that the schooner had been struck
down by a sudden gale. He had grown more or less accustomed
to such occurrences and to sleeping fully dressed,
and in another moment or two he was out of the deck-house.
A sharp wind drove stinging flakes of snow into
his face. It was very dark, but he guessed that the schooner&#8217;s
rail was in the sea, which was washing the decks, and
that some of the crew were struggling to get the mainsail
off her. A man whom he supposed to be Charly ran into
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better come for&#8217;ard. Got to haul outer jib down before
it blows away!&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>Up to his knees in water, Wyllard staggered after him
and made out by the mad banging that some one had already
cast the peak of the boom-foresail loose. He reached
the windlass, and clutched it, as a sea that took him to the
waist frothed in over the weather rail. The bows lurched
out of it viciously, hurling another icy flood back on him,
and he could see a dim white chaos of frothing water about
and beneath them. Above rose the black wedge of the jibs.
</p>
<p>He did not want to get out along the bowsprit to stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
one of them down, but there are many things flesh and
blood shrink from which must be faced at sea. He made
out that a Siwash was fumbling at the down-haul made
fast near his side, and when the man&#8217;s shadowy figure rose
up against the whiteness of the foam he made a jump forward.
Then he was on the bowsprit, lying upon it while
he felt for the foot-rope slung beneath. He found it, and
was cautiously lowering himself when the man in front of
him called out harshly, and he saw a white sea range up
ahead. It broke short over with a rush and roar, and he
clung with hands and feet for his life as the schooner&#8217;s
dipping bows rammed the seething mass.
</p>
<p>The vessel went into it to the windlass. Wyllard was
smothered in an icy flood that seemed bent on wrenching
him from his hold, but that was only for a moment or two,
and then, streaming with water, he was swung high above
the sea again. It was bad enough merely to hold on, but
that was a very small share of his task, for the big black
sail that cut the higher darkness came rattling down its
stay and fell upon him and his companion. As it dropped
the wind took hold of the folds of it and buffeted them
cruelly. As he clutched at the canvas it seemed to him
incredible that he had not already been flung off headlong
from the reeling spar. Still, that banging, thrashing canvas
must be mastered somehow, though it was snow-soaked
and almost unyielding, and with bleeding hands he clawed
at it furiously while twice the bowsprit raked a sea and
dipped him waist-deep into the water. At last, the other
man flung him the end of the gasket, and they worked
back carefully, leaving the sail lashed down, and scrambled
aft to help the others who were making the big main-boom
fast. When this was done Wyllard fell against
Dampier and clutched at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the wind?&#8221; he roared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Northeast,&#8221; answered the skipper.
</p>
<p>They could scarcely hear each other, though the schooner
was lurching over it more easily now with shortened canvas,
and Wyllard made Dampier understand that he wished
to speak to him only by thrusting him towards the deck-house
door. They went in together, and stood clutching at
the table with the lamplight on their tense, wet faces and
the brine that ran from them making pools upon the deck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind has hauled round,&#8221; said the skipper, &#8220;the
wrong way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made a savage gesture. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had it from
the last quarter we wanted ever since we sailed, and we
sailed nearly three months too late. We&#8217;re too close in to
the beach for you to heave her to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A sure thing,&#8221; agreed Dampier. &#8220;I was driving her
to work off it with the sea getting up when the breeze burst
on us. She put her rail right under, and we had to let
go &#8217;most everything before she&#8217;d pick it up. She&#8217;s pointing
somewhere north, jammed right up on the starboard tack
just now, but I can&#8217;t stand on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was evident to Wyllard, and he closed one hand
tight. He wanted to stand on as long as possible before
the ice closed in, but he realized that to do so would put
the schooner ashore.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he questioned sharply.
</p>
<p>Dampier made a grimace. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out to heave her
round. If we&#8217;d any sense in us we&#8217;d square off the boom
then, and leg it away across the Pacific for Vancouver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; observed Wyllard, &#8220;somebody would
lose his bonus.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The skipper swung around on him with a flash in his
eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
&#8220;The bonus!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Who was it came for
you with two dollars in his pocket after he&#8217;d bought his
ticket from Vancouver?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled at him. &#8220;If you took that up the wrong
way I&#8217;m sorry. She ought to work off on the port track,
and when we&#8217;ve open water to leeward you can heave her
to. When it moderates we can pick up the beach again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I mean to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier went out on deck, while Wyllard, flinging off
his dripping clothing, crawled into his bunk and went
quietly to sleep.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST ICE</h3>
</div>

<p>Before they hove to the <i>Selache</i>, daylight broke on a
frothing sea, across which scudded wisps of smoke-adrift
and thin showers of snow. With two little wet rags of
canvas set the schooner lay almost head on to the big
combers. Having little way upon her, she lurched over instead
of ramming the waves, and though now and then one
curled on board across her rail it was not often that there
was much heavy water upon her slanted deck.
</p>
<p>All around the narrow circle a leaden sky met the sea.
It was bitterly cold, and the spray stung the skin like half-spent
pellets from a gun. There was only one man, in
turn, exposed to the weather, and he had little to do but
brace himself against the savage buffeting of the wind as
he clutched the wheel. The <i>Selache</i>, for the most part,
steered herself, lifting buoyantly while the froth came
sluicing aft from her tilted bows, falling off a little with
a vicious leeward roll when a comber bigger than usual
smote her to weather, and coming up again streaming to
meet the next. Sometimes she forged ahead in what is
called at sea, by courtesy, a &#8220;smooth,&#8221; and all the time
shroud and stay to weather gave out tumultuous harmonies,
and the slack of every rope to leeward blew out in
unyielding curves.
</p>
<p>Three of the white men lay sleeping or smoking in the
little cabin, which was partly raised above and partly sunk
beneath the after-deck. It was a reasonably strong structure,
but it worked, and sweated, as they sat at sea, and
the heat of the stove had further opened up the seams in it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Moisture dripped from the beams overhead, moisture
trickled up and down the slanting deck, there were great
globules of water on the bulk-heading, and everything, including
the men&#8217;s clothes and blankets, was wet. The men
lay in their bunks from necessity, because it was a laborious
matter to sit. They said very little since it was difficult
to hear anything amid the cataclysm of elemental
sound. It became at length almost a relief to turn out
into inky darkness or misty daylight, dimmed by flying
spray, to take a turn at the jarring wheel.
</p>
<p>For three days the bad weather continued, and then,
when the gale broke and a little pale sunshine streamed
down on the tumbling sea, changing the gray combers to
flashing white and green, the skipper gave her a double-reefed
mainsail, part of the boom-foresail, and a jib or
two, and thrashed her slowly back to the northward on
the starboard tack. More than one of the men glanced
over the taffrail longingly as the schooner gathered way.
She was fast, and with a little driving and that breeze over
her quarter she would bear them south toward warmth and
ease at some two hundred miles a day, while the way they
were going it would be a fight for every fathom with bitter,
charging seas, and there lay ahead of them only cold and
peril and toil incredible.
</p>
<p>There are times at sea when human nature revolts from
the strain that the overtaxed body must bear, the leaden
weariness of worn-out limbs, and the subconscious effort
to retain warmth and vitality in spite of the ceaseless lashing
of the icy gale. Then, as aching muscles grow lax,
the nervous tension becomes more insupportable, unless,
indeed, utter weariness breeds indifference to the personal
peril each time the decks are swept by a frothing flood, or
a slippery spar must be clung to with frost-numbed and
often bleeding hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
The men on the <i>Selache</i> knew this, and it was to their
credit that they obeyed when Dampier gave the word to
put the helm up and trim the sheets over. Wyllard, however,
stood a little apart with a hard-set face, and he
looked forward over the plunging bows, for he was troubled
by a sense of responsibility such as he had not felt since
he had, one night several years before, asked for volunteers.
He realized that an account of these men&#8217;s lives
might be demanded from him.
</p>
<p>It was a fortnight later, and they had twice made a perilous
landing without finding any sign of life on or behind
the hammered beach, when they ran into the first of the
ice. The gray day was near its end. The long heave
faintly twinkling here and there, ran sluggishly after them.
When creeping through a belt of haze they came into sight
of several blurrs of grayish white that swung with the dim,
green swell. The <i>Selache</i> was slowly lurching over it with
everything aloft to the topsails then, and Dampier
glanced at the ice with a feeling of deep anxiety.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier than I expected,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Anyway,
it&#8217;s a sure thing there&#8217;s plenty more where that came
from.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Big patch away to starboard!&#8221; cried a man in the
foremast shrouds.
</p>
<p>Dampier turned to Wyllard. &#8220;What are you going to
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s most advisable?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The skipper looked grave. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s
quite simple. Get out of this, and head her south just as
soon as we can, but I guess that&#8217;s not quite what you
mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Wyllard. &#8220;I meant for the next few
hours or so. In a general way, we&#8217;re still pushing on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying much about pushing her through.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
That ice is light and scattered, and as she&#8217;s going it won&#8217;t
hurt her much if she plugs some in the dark. It&#8217;s what
we&#8217;re going to do the next two weeks that I&#8217;m not sure
about. If there&#8217;s ice we mayn&#8217;t fetch the creek, where
we&#8217;d figured on laying her up. It&#8217;s still most a hundred
miles to the north of us. The other inlet I&#8217;d fixed on is
way further south.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This brought them back to the difficulty with which they
had grappled at many a council. The men for whom they
searched might have gone either north or south, or they
might have gone inland, if, indeed, any of them survived.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we only knew how they had headed,&#8221; said Wyllard
quietly. &#8220;Still, right or not, I&#8217;m for pushing on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Charly, who held the wheel, broke in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s north,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;They&#8217;d have no
use for fetching up among the Russians, and there&#8217;s nobody
else until you get to Japan. No white men, anyway.
Besides, from the Behring Sea to the Kuriles is quite a
long way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were dumped down ashore there, which way
would you go?&#8221; Dampier asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d a wallet full of papers certifying me as a harmless
traveler, it would be south just as hard as I could hit
the trail. Guess I&#8217;d strike somebody out prospecting, or
surveying, and they&#8217;d set me along to the Kuriles. Still,
if I&#8217;d been sealing, I wouldn&#8217;t head that way. No, sir.
That&#8217;s dead sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a reason for this certainty, right or wrong, in
the minds of the sealers. How many of the skins they
brought home were obtained in open water where they
could fish without molestation they alone knew; but they
were regarded in certain quarters as poachers and outlaws,
who deserved no mercy. They had their differences with
the Americans who owned the Pribilofs. It was admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
that the Americans had bought the islands, and might reasonably
be considered to have some claim upon the seals
which frequented them. The free-lances bore their execrations
and reprisals more or less resignedly, though that
did not prevent them from occasionally exchanging compliments
with oar butts or sealing clubs. But the Muscovite
was a grim, mysterious figure they feared and hated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d have tried up north?&#8221; Wyllard suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; answered the helmsman. &#8220;If I&#8217;d a boat and a
rifle, and it was summer, I&#8217;d have pushed across for Alaska.
You can eat birds and walrus, and a man might eat a fur-seal
if he&#8217;d had nothing else for a week, though I&#8217;ve struck
nothing that has more smell than the holluschickie blubber.
If it was winter, I&#8217;d have tried the ice. The Huskies
make out on it for weeks together, and quite a few of the
steam whaler men have trailed an odd hundred or two
miles over it one time or another. They hadn&#8217;t tents and
dog-teams either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s face grew anxious. He had naturally considered
both courses, and had decided that they were out
of the question. Seas do not freeze up solid, and that
three men should transport a boat, supposing that they had
one, over leagues of ice appeared impossible. An attempt
to cross the narrow sea, which is either wrapped in mist or
swept by sudden gales, in any open craft would clearly result
only in disaster, but, admitting that, he felt that, had
he been in those men&#8217;s place, he would have headed north.
There was one question which had all along remained unanswered,
and that was how they had reached the coast
from which they had sent their message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he said, after a long pause, &#8220;we&#8217;ll stand on,
and run into the creek we&#8217;ve fixed on, if it&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dusk had closed down on them, and it had grown perceptibly
colder. The haze crystallized on the rigging, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
rail was white with rime, and the deck grew slippery, but
they left everything on the <i>Selache</i> to the topsails, and she
crept on erratically through the darkness, avoiding the
faint spectral glimmer of the scattered ice. The breeze
abeam propelled her with gently leaning canvas at some
four knots to the hour, and now and then Wyllard, who
hung about the deck that night, fancied he could hear a
thin, sharp crackle beneath the slowly lifting bows.
</p>
<p>Next day the haze thickened, and there seemed to be
more ice about, but the breeze was fresher, and there was,
at least, no skin upon the ruffled sea. They took off the
topsails, and proceeded cautiously, with two men with logger&#8217;s
pikepoles forward, and another in the eyes of the foremast
rigging. They struck nothing, fortunately, and when
night came the <i>Selache</i> lay rolling in a heavy, portentous
calm. Dampier and one or two of the men declared their
certainty that there was ice near them, but, at least, they
could not see it, though there was now no doubt about the
crackling beneath the schooner&#8217;s side. It was an anxious
night for most of the crew, but a breeze that drove the
haze aside got up with the sun, and Dampier expected to
reach the creek before darkness fell. He might have succeeded
but for the glistening streak on the horizon, which
presently crept in on them, and resolved itself into detached
gray-white masses, with openings of various sizes in and
out between them. The breeze was freshening, and the
<i>Selache</i> was going through it at some six knots, when
Dampier came aft to Wyllard, who was standing at the
wheel. There was a moderately wide opening in the floating
barrier close ahead of him. The rest of the crew stood
silent watching the skipper, for they were by this time
more or less acquainted with Wyllard&#8217;s temperament.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get through that,&#8221; said Dampier, pointing
to the ice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Wyllard looked at him sourly, and the white men, at
least, understood what he was feeling. So far, he had had
everything against him&mdash;calm, and fog, and sudden gale&mdash;and
now, when he was almost within sight of the end of
the first stage of his journey, they had met the ice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure of that?&#8221; he questioned.
</p>
<p>Dampier smiled. &#8220;It would cost too much, or I&#8217;d let
you try.&#8221; He called to the man perched high in the foremost
shrouds, and the answer came down: &#8220;Packed right
solid a couple of miles ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard lifted one hand, and let it suddenly fall again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lee, oh! We&#8217;ll have her round,&#8221; he said, and spun
the wheel.
</p>
<p>The men breathed more easily as they jumped for the
sheets, and with a great banging and thrashing of sailcloth
the vessel shot up to windward, and turned as on a pivot.
As the schooner gathered way on the other tack, the men
glanced at Wyllard, for the <i>Selache&#8217;s</i> bows were pointing
to the southeast again, and they felt that was not the way
he was going.
</p>
<p>Wyllard turned to Dampier with a gesture of impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Baulked again!&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would have been a relief
to have rammed her in. With this breeze we&#8217;d have
picked that creek up in the next six hours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; replied Dampier, who glanced at the swirling
wake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if we can&#8217;t get through the ice we can work the
schooner round. Stand by to flatten all sheets in, boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They obeyed orders cheerfully, though they knew it
meant a thrash to windward along the perilous edge of the
ice. Soon the windlass was caked with glistening ice, and
long spikes of it hung from her rail, while the slippery
crystals gathered thick on deck. Lumps and floes of ice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
detached themselves from the parent mass, and sailed out
to meet the vessel, crashing on one another, while it
seemed to the men who watched him that Wyllard tried
how closely he could shave them before he ran the <i>Selache</i>
off with a vicious drag at the wheel. None of them, however,
cared to utter a remonstrance.
</p>
<p>They brought the schooner around when she had
stretched out on the one tack a couple of miles, and, standing
in again close-hauled, found the ice thicker than ever.
Then she came around once more, and, until the early dusk
fell, Wyllard stood at the jarring helm or high up in the
forward shrouds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t work along the edge in the dark,&#8221; he said
to Dampier.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered the skipper dryly, &#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t be
wise. We could stand on as she&#8217;s lying until half through
the night, and then come round and pick up the ice again
a little before sun-up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made a sign of acquiescence. &#8220;Then,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;don&#8217;t call me until you&#8217;re in sight of it. A day of this
kind takes it out of one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved aft heavily toward the deck-house, and Dampier
watched him with a smile of comprehension, for he
was a man who had in his time made many fruitless efforts,
and bravely faced defeat. After all, it is possible
that when the final reckoning comes some failures will
count.
</p>
<p>For several hours the <i>Selache</i> stretched out close-hauled
into what they supposed to be open water, and they certainly
saw no ice. They hove her to, and when the wind
fell light brought her round and crept back slowly upon
the opposite tack. Wyllard had gone to sleep after his
day of anxious work, and daylight was just breaking when
he next went out on deck. There was scarcely a breath of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
wind and the heavy calm seemed portentous and unnatural.
The schooner lay lurching on a sluggish swell, with
the frost-wool thick on her rigging, and a belt of haze
ahead of her. The ice glimmered in the growing light,
but in one or two places stretches of blue-gray water
seemed to penetrate it, and Dampier, who strode aft when
he saw Wyllard, said he believed that there must be an
opening somewhere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the thickness of it, that ice has formed some time,
and as we&#8217;ve seen nothing but a skin it must have come
from further north,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It gathered up under a
point or in a bay most likely, until a shift of wind broke
it out, and the stream or breeze sent it down this way. That
seems to indicate that there can&#8217;t be a great deal of it,
but a few days&#8217; calm and frost would freeze it solid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Wyllard returned impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It lies between us and the inlet, and it&#8217;s quite clear
that we can&#8217;t stay where we are. Once we got nipped,
there&#8217;d probably be an end of her. We must get into that
inlet at once or make for the other further south.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard shook his head. &#8220;It all leads back to the same
point. We must get through the ice. The one question
is&mdash;how is it to be done?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With a working breeze I&#8217;d stand into the biggest opening,
but as there&#8217;s none we&#8217;ll wait until it clears a little,
and then send a boat in. The sun may bring the wind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They had breakfast while they waited, but the wind did
not come, and it was several hours later when a pale coppery
disc became visible and the haze grew thinner. Then
they swung a boat out hastily, for it would not be very
long before the light died away again. Two white men
and an Indian dropped into the boat and they pulled
across half a mile of sluggishly heaving water, crept up an
opening, and presently vanished among the ice. Soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
afterward the low sun went out, and wisps of ragged cloud
crept up from the westward, while smears of vapor
blurred the horizon, and the swell grew steeper. There
was no wind at all, but blocks and canvas banged and
thrashed furiously at every roll, until they lowered the
mainsail and lashed its heavy boom to the big iron crutch
astern. The boat remained invisible, but its crew had
been given instructions to push on as far as possible if
they found clear water, and Dampier, who did not seem
uneasy about the men, paced up and down the deck while
the afternoon wore away.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>DEFEAT</h3>
</div>

<p>A gray dimness was creeping in upon the schooner when
a bitter breeze sprang tip from the westward, and Dampier
bade the crew get the mainsail on to the <i>Selache</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the look of the weather, and I&#8217;m beginning
to feel that I&#8217;d like to see that boat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anyhow,
we&#8217;ll get way on her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a relief to hoist the mainsail. The work put a
little warmth into the sailors. The white men had been
conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in
the boat, and action of any sort was welcome. The breeze
had freshened before they set the sail, and there were whitecaps
on the water when the <i>Selache</i> headed for the ice,
which had somewhat changed its formation, for big masses
had become detached from it and were moving out into the
water, while the open space had become perceptibly
narrower. The light was now fading rapidly, and Wyllard
took the wheel when Dampier sent forward the man
who had held it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the cover off the second boat, and see everything
clear for hoisting out,&#8221; commanded the skipper, and then
called to Wyllard, &#8220;We&#8217;re close enough. You&#8217;d better
heave her round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The schooner came around with a thrashing of canvas,
stretched out seawards, and came back again with her deck
sharply slanted and little puffs of spray blowing over her
weather-rail, for there was no doubt that the breeze was
freshening fast. Dampier now sent a man up into the
foremast shrouds, and looked at Wyllard afterward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d heave a couple of reefs down if I wasn&#8217;t so anxious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
about that blamed boat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As it is, I want to
be ready to pick her up just as soon as we see her, and it&#8217;s
quite likely she&#8217;d turn up when we&#8217;d got way off the
schooner, and the peak eased down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard realized that Dampier was right as he glanced
over the rail at the dimness that was creeping in on them.
It was blowing almost fresh by this time, and the <i>Selache</i>
was driving very fast through the swell, which began to
froth here and there. It is, as he knew from experience,
always hard work, and often impossible, to pull a boat to
windward in any weight of breeze, which rendered it advisable
to keep the schooner under way. If the boat drove
by them while they were reefing it might be difficult to
pick her up afterwards in the dark. He was now distinctly
anxious about her. Just as the light was dying
out, the man in the shrouds sent down a cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see them, sir!&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Dampier turned to Wyllard with a gesture of relief.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a weight off my mind. I wish we had a reef in,
but&#8221;&mdash;he glanced up at the canvas&mdash;&#8220;she&#8217;ll have to stand
it. Anyway, I&#8217;ll leave you there. We want to get that
second boat lashed down again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This, as Wyllard recognized, was necessary, though he
would rather have had somebody by him and the rest of
them ready to let the mainsheet run, inasmuch as he was a
little to windward of the opening, and surmised that he
would have to run the schooner down upon the boat. It
was a few moments later when he saw the boat emerge
from the ice, and the men in her appeared to be pulling
strenuously. They were, perhaps, half a mile off, and the
schooner, heading for the ice, was sailing very fast. Wyllard
lost sight of the boat again, for a thin shower of
whirling snow suddenly obscured the light. Dampier
called to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to run her off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Boys, slack
out your sheets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a clatter of blocks, and when Wyllard pulled
his helm up it taxed all his strength. The <i>Selache</i> swung
around, and he gasped with the effort to control her as she
drove away furiously into the thickening snow. She was
carrying far too much canvas, but they could not heave
her to and take it off her now. The boat must be picked
up first, and the veins rose swollen to Wyllard&#8217;s forehead
as he struggled with the wheel. There is always a certain
possibility of bringing a fore-and-aft rigged vessel&#8217;s main-boom
over when she is running hard, and this is apt to result
in disaster to her spars. So fast was the <i>Selache</i>
traveling that the sea piled up in big white waves beneath
her quarter, and, cold as the day was, the sweat of tense
effort dripped from Wyllard as he foresaw what he had to
do. First of all, he must hold the schooner straight before
the wind without letting her fall off to leeward, which
would bring the booms crashing over; then he must run
past the boat, which he could no longer see, and round up
the schooner with fore-staysail aback to leeward of her,
to wait until she drove down on them.
</p>
<p>This would not have been difficult in a moderate breeze,
but the wind was blowing furiously and the schooner was
greatly pressed with sail. He thought of calling the others
to lower the mainsail peak, but with the weight of wind
there was in the canvas he was not sure that they could
haul down the gaff. Besides, they were busy securing the
boat, which must be made fast again before they hove the
other in, and it was almost dark now. In view of what
had happened in the same waters one night, four years
before, the desire to pick up the boat while there was a
little light left became an obsession.
</p>
<p>The swell was rapidly whitening and getting steeper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
The <i>Selache</i> hove herself out of it forward as she swung
up with streaming bows. It seemed to Wyllard that he
must overrun the boat before he noticed her, but at last
he saw Dampier swing himself on to the rail. The skipper
stood there clutching at a shroud, and presently swinging
an arm, turned toward Wyllard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight ahead!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Let her come up a few
points before you run over them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard put his helm down a spoke or two, which was
easy, and then as the bows swung high again there was a
harsh cry from the man who stood above Dampier in the
shrouds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ice!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Big pack of it right under your
weather bow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier shouted something, but Wyllard did not hear
what he said. He was conscious only that he had to decide
what he must do in the next few seconds. If he let
the <i>Selache</i> come up to avoid the boat, there was the ice
ahead, and at the speed she was traveling it would infallibly
incrush her bows, while if he held her straight there
was the boat close in front of her. To swing her clear of
both by going to leeward he must bring the mainsail and
boom-foresail over with a tremendous shock, but that
seemed preferable, and with his heart in his mouth he
pulled his helm up.
</p>
<p>He fancied he cried out in warning, but was never sure
of it, though three men came running to seize the mainsheet.
The schooner fell off a little, swinging until the
boom-foresail came over with a thunderous bang and crash.
She rolled down, heaving a wide strip of wet planking out
of the sea, and now for a moment or two there were great
breadths of canvas swung out on either hand. Then the
ponderous main-boom went up high above his head, and
he saw three shadowy figures dragged aft as they tried in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
vain to steady it The big mainsail was bunched up, a
vast, portentous shape above him, and he set his lips, and
pulled up the helm another spoke as it swung.
</p>
<p>He never quite knew what happened after that. There
was a horrible crash, and the schooner appeared to be rolling
over bodily. The spokes he clung to desperately reft
themselves from his grasp, the deck slanted until one could
not stand upon it, and something heavy struck him on the
head. He dropped, and Dampier flung himself upon the
wheel above his senseless body.
</p>
<p>There was mad confusion, and a frantic banging of canvas
as the schooner came up beam to the wind, with her
rent mainsail flogging itself to tatters. Its ponderous
boom was broken, and the mainmast-head had gone, but it
was not the first time the sealers had grappled with similar
difficulties, and Dampier kept his head. He had the
boat to think of, and she was somewhere to windward, hidden
in the sudden darkness and the turmoil of the quickly
rising sea, but the schooner counted most of all! His
crew could scarcely hear him through the uproar made by
the thundering canvas, and the screaming of the wind,
but the orders were given, and from habit and the custom
of their calling the men knew what the commands must be.
</p>
<p>They hauled a jib down, backed the fore-staysail, and
got the boom-foresail sheeted in, but they let the rent
mainsail bang, for it could do no more damage than it had
already done.
</p>
<p>A man sprang up on the rail with a blue light in his
hand, and as the weird radiance flared in a long streak to
leeward a cry rose from the water. In another few moments
a blurred object, half hidden in flying spray, drove
down upon the schooner furiously on the top of a sea, and
then there was sudden darkness as the man flung down
the torch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>Another harsh and half-heard cry rose out of the obscurity.
An indistinguishable object plunged past the
schooner&#8217;s stern, there was a crash to leeward as the
schooner rolled, and a man standing up in the boat clutched
her rail. The man was swung out of it as the vessel rolled
back again, but he crawled on to the rail with a rope in one
hand, and after jamming it fast around something, he
sprang down with the hooks of the lifting tackles which
one of the crew had given him. While two more men
scrambled up, there was a clatter of blocks, but a shattered
sea struck the boat as they hove her clear, and, when she
swung in, the brine poured out through the rents in her.
Dampier waved an arm as they dropped her on the deck,
and they heard him faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;you have got to cut that mainsail
down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They obeyed somehow, hanging on to the mast-hoops,
and now and then enveloped by the madly flogging canvas.
After that they trimmed her fore-staysail over, and there
was by contrast a curious quietness as Dampier jammed his
helm up, and the schooner swung off before the sea.
</p>
<p>Then somebody lighted a lantern, and Charly stooped
over Wyllard, who lay limp and still beside the wheel. In
the feeble light, Wyllard&#8217;s face showed gray except where
a broad red stain had spread across it. Dampier cast a
glance at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get him below, and into his bunk, two of you,&#8221; he
commanded.
</p>
<p>The men carried him with difficulty, for the <i>Selache</i>
lurched viciously each time a white-topped sea came up
upon her quarter. As soon as it seemed advisable to leave
the deck Dampier went down. Wyllard lay in his bunk, with
his eyes half-open. His face was colorless except for the
broad smear of blood, which was oozing fast from a laceration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
in his scalp. Dampier, who noticed his chilliness, did
not trouble about the wound. He stripped off the senseless
man&#8217;s long boots, and, unshipping a hot fender iron
from the stove, laid it against his feet. Afterward he contrived
to get some whisky down Wyllard&#8217;s throat, and then
he set to work to wash the scalp wound, dropping into the
water a little of the permanganate of potash, which is
freely used at sea. When that was done he applied a rag
dipped in the same fluid, and seeing no result of his efforts
went back on deck. He was anxious about his patient,
but not unduly so, for he had discovered long ago that
men of Wyllard&#8217;s type are apt to recover from more serious
injuries.
</p>
<p>It was blowing very hard when the skipper stood near
the wheel. A steep sea was already tumbling after the
schooner, but she was, at least, heading out from where
they supposed the ice to be, and he let her go, keeping her
away before it, and heading a little south of east. The
next morning the sea was very high, and the faint light
was further dimmed by snow, but it seemed safe to Dampier,
and the vessel held on while the big combers came
up astern and forged by high above her rail.
</p>
<p>The <i>Selache</i> was traveling fast to the eastward. She
was under boom-foresail and one little jib, with her mainmast
broken short off where the bolts of the halliard blocks
had traversed it. Dampier realized that every knot the
vessel made then could not be recovered that season. He
wondered, with a little uneasiness, what Wyllard would say
when he came to himself again.
</p>
<p>Next day the breeze moderated somewhat, and they let
the schooner come up a little, heading further south. On
the morning after that Wyllard showed signs of returning
consciousness. Dampier, however, kept away from him,
partly to allow his senses to readjust themselves, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
partly because he shrank from the necessary interview.
When dusk was falling, Charly went on deck to say that
Wyllard, who seemed perfectly conscious, insisted on seeing
the skipper, and with some misgivings Dampier went
down into the little cabin. The lamp was lighted, and
when he sat down Wyllard, who raised himself feebly on
his pillow, turned a pallid face to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Charly tells me you picked the boat up,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We did,&#8221; answered Dampier. &#8220;She had three or four
planks on one side ripped out of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s faint grimace implied that this did not matter,
and Dampier braced himself for the question he
dreaded. He had to face it another moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she heading?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little south of east.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s face hardened. It was still blowing moderately
and by the heave of the vessel and the wash of water
outside he could guess how fast she was traveling. For a
moment or two there was an oppressive silence in the little
cabin. Then Wyllard spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been running to the eastwards since I was
struck down?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Dampier nodded. &#8220;Three days,&#8221; he confessed. &#8220;Just
now the breeze is on her quarter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He winced under Wyllard&#8217;s gaze, and spread out his
hands with a deprecating gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he added, &#8220;what else was there I could do?
She wrung her masthead off when you jibed her and there&#8217;s
not stick enough left to set any canvas that would shove
her to windward. I might have hove her to, but the first
time the breeze hauled easterly she&#8217;d have gone up on the
beach or among the ice with us. I had to run!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard closed a feeble hand. &#8220;Dunton was crippled,
too. It&#8217;s almost incredible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In one way, it looks like that, but, after all, a jibe&#8217;s
quite a common thing with a fore-and-after. If you run
her off to lee when she&#8217;s going before it, her mainboom&#8217;s
bound to come over. Of course, nobody would run her off
in a wicked breeze unless he had to, but you&#8217;d no choice
with the ice in front of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard lay very still for a minute. It was clear to him
that his project must be abandoned for that season, which
meant that at least six months must elapse before he could
even approach the Kamtchatkan coast again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he inquired at length, &#8220;what do you mean to
do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the breeze holds we could pick up one of the Aleutians
in a few days, but I&#8217;m keeping south of the islands.
There&#8217;ll probably be ugly ice along the beaches, and I&#8217;ve
no fancy for being cast ashore by a strong tide when the
fog lies on the land. With westerly winds I&#8217;d sooner hold
on for Alaska. We could lie snug in an inlet there, and,
it&#8217;s quite likely, get a cedar that would make a spar. I
can&#8217;t head right away for Vancouver with no mainsail.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was clear to Wyllard, who made a weak gesture.
&#8220;If the wind comes easterly?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier pursed up his lips. &#8220;Then, unless I could
fetch one of the Kuriles, we&#8217;d sure be jammed. She won&#8217;t
beat to windward, and there&#8217;d be all Kamtchatka to lee
of us. The ice is packing up along the north of it now,
and the Russians have two or three settlements to the
south. We don&#8217;t want to run in and tell them what we&#8217;re
after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A faint smile touched Wyllard&#8217;s lips. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;not after that little affair on the beach. Since it&#8217;s very
probable that the vessel they send up to the seal islands
would deliver store along the coast, the folks in authority
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
would have a record of it. They would call the thing piracy&mdash;and,
in a sense, they&#8217;d be justified.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent for a few moments, and then looked up
again wearily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;how that boat&#8217;s crew ever
got across to Kamtchatka. It was north of the islands
where the man brought Dunton the message.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier understood that Wyllard desired to change the
subject, for this was a question they had often discussed
already.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I still hold to my first notion.
They were blown ashore on the beach we have just left,
and made prisoners. Then a supply schooner or perhaps
a steamer came along, and they were sent off in her to be
handed over to the authorities. The vessel put in somewhere.
We&#8217;ll say she was lying in an inlet with a boat
astern, and somehow our friends cut that boat loose in the
dark, and got away in her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment to look at his companion significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can find quite a few points where that idea seems
to fail,&#8221; he added. &#8220;They were in Kamtchatka, but I&#8217;m
beginning to feel that we shall never know any more than
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made a gesture of concurrence, but in his face
Dampier saw no sign that he meant to abandon his project.
He seemed to sink into sleep, and the skipper, who went up
on deck, paced to and fro a while before he stopped by the
wheel and turned to the helmsman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can let her come up a couple of points. We may
as well make a little southing while we can,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Charly, who was steering, looked up with suggestive
eagerness. &#8220;Then he&#8217;s not going for the Aleutians?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Dampier dryly. &#8220;I was kind of afraid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
of that, but I choked him off. Anyway, this year won&#8217;t
see us back in Vancouver.&#8221; He paused. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to
stay up here until we find out where those men left their
bones. The man who has this thing in hand isn&#8217;t the
kind that lets up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly made no answer, but his face hardened as he put
his helm down a spoke or two.
</p>
<p>Next day the wind fell lighter, but for a week it still
held westerly, and after that it blew moderately fresh from
the south. Crippled as she was, the <i>Selache</i> would lie a
point or two south of east when they had set an old cut-down
fore-staysail on what was left of her mainmast. The
hearts of her crew became lighter as she crawled on across
the Pacific. The men had no wish to be blown back to the
frozen North.
</p>
<p>The days were growing shorter rapidly, and the sun hung
low in the southern sky when at last the schooner crept
into one of the many inlets that indent the coast of Southern
Alaska. There was just wind enough to carry her in
around a long, foam-lapped point, and soon afterwards
they let the anchor go in four fathoms of water. Their
haven was a sheltered arm of the sea with a river mouth
not far away. There was no sign of life anywhere and the
ragged cedars that crept close down to the beach stood out
in somber spires against the gleaming snow.
</p>
<p>The cold was not particularly severe when the <i>Selache</i>
arrived, but when Dampier went ashore next morning to
pick a log from which they could hew a mast the temperature
suddenly fell, and that night the drift ice from the
river mouth closed in on them. When the late daylight
broke the schooner was frozen fast, and they knew it would
be several months before she moved again. It was before
the gold rush, and in winter Alaska was practically cut off
from all communication with the south. No man would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
have attempted to traverse the tremendous snow-wrapped
desolation of almost impassable hills and trackless forests
that lay between them and the nearest of the commercial
factories on the north, or the canneries on the other hand.
Besides, the canneries were shut up in winter time. They
were prisoners, and could only wait with what patience
they could muster until the thaw set them free again.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A DELICATE ERRAND</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a sharp frost outside, and the prairie was white
with a thin sprinkle of snow, when a little party sat down
to supper in the Hastings homestead, one Saturday evening.
Hastings sat at the head of the table, Mrs. Hastings
at the foot with her little daughters, and Agatha, Sproatly,
and Winifred between them. Sproatly and Winifred had
just driven over from the railroad settlement, as they did
now and then, and that was why the meal, which was usually
served early in the evening, had been delayed an hour
or so. The two hired men, whom Mrs. Hastings had not
kept waiting, had gone out to some task in the barn or
stables.
</p>
<p>Sproatly took a bundle of papers out of his pocket and
laid them on the table. There had been a remarkable
change in his appearance, for he now wore store clothes,
and the skin coat he had taken off when he came in was a
new one. It occurred to Mrs. Hastings that there was a
certain significance in this, though Sproatly had changed
his occupation some time before, and now drove about the
prairie as an agent for certain makers of agricultural
implements.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I called for your mail and Gregory&#8217;s before we left,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I had to go around to see Hawtrey, which is
partly what made us so late, though Winifred couldn&#8217;t get
away as soon as she expected. They have floods of wheat
coming in to the elevators and I understand that the milling
people can&#8217;t take another bushel in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings glanced at Agatha, who understood what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
the look meant, for Sproatly had hitherto spoken of Winifred
circumspectly as Miss Rawlinson.
</p>
<p>Hastings took the papers which Agatha handed to him
and laid them aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let them wait until supper&#8217;s over. I don&#8217;t expect
any news that&#8217;s particularly good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
bottom&#8217;s apparently dropping out of the wheat market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hamilton can&#8217;t get cars enough, and we&#8217;ll have to
shut down in another day or two unless they turn up,&#8221; remarked
Winifred. &#8220;It&#8217;s much the same all along the line.
The Winnipeg traffic people wired us that they haven&#8217;t an
empty car in the yards. Why do you rush the grain in
that way? It&#8217;s bound to break the market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings smiled. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;a good many
of us have bills to meet. For another thing, they&#8217;ve had a
heavy crop in Manitoba, Dakota and Minnesota, and I
suppose some folks have an idea they&#8217;ll get in first before
the other people swamp the Eastern markets. I think
they&#8217;re foolish. It&#8217;s a temporary scare. Prices will stiffen
by and by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Mr. Hamilton says, but I suppose the
thing is natural. Men are very like sheep, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hastings laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;we are,
in some respects. When prices break a little we generally
rush to sell. One or two of my neighbors are holding on,
and it&#8217;s hardly likely that very much of my wheat will be
flung on to a falling market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been getting a good deal from the Range.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was displeasure in Hastings&#8217; face. &#8220;Gregory&#8217;s
selling largely on Harry&#8217;s account?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been hauling wheat in to us for the last few
weeks,&#8221; said Winifred.
</p>
<p>Agatha noticed that Hastings glanced at his wife significantly,
but Mrs. Hastings interposed and forbade any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
further conversation on the subject until supper was over.
After the table had been cleared Hastings opened his papers.
The others sat expectantly silent, while he turned
the pages over one after another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s no news of Harry, and I&#8217;m
afraid it&#8217;s scarcely possible that we&#8217;ll hear anything of him
this winter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was conscious that Mrs. Hastings&#8217; eyes were upon
her, and she sat very still, though her heart was beating
faster than usual. Hastings went on again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Colonist</i> has a line or two about a barque from
Alaska which put into Victoria short of stores. She was
sent up to an A. C. C. factory, and had to clear out before
she was ready. The ice, it seems, was closing in unusually
early. A steam whaler at Portland reports the same thing,
and from the news brought by a steamer from Japan all
communication with Northeastern Asia is already cut
off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment or two, and Agatha, leaning
back in her chair, glanced around the room. There was
not much furniture in it, but, though this was unusual on
the prairie, door and double casements were guarded by
heavy hangings. The big brass lamp overhead shed a
cheerful light, and birch wood in the stove snapped and
cracked noisily, and the stove-pipe, which was far too hot
to touch, diffused a drowsy heat. One could lounge beside
the fire contentedly, knowing that the stinging frost was
drying the snow to dusty powder outside. The cozy room
heightened the contrast that all recognized in thinking of
Wyllard. Agatha pictured the little schooner bound fast
in the Northern ice, and then two or three travel-worn
men crouching in a tiny tent that was buffeted by an Arctic
gale. She could see the poles bend, and the tricings
strain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>After that, with a sudden transition, her thoughts went
back to the early morning when Wyllard had driven away,
and every detail of the scene rose up clearly in her mind.
She saw him and the stolid Dampier sitting in the wagon,
with nothing in their manner to suggest that they were
setting out upon a perilous venture, and she felt his hand
close tight upon her fingers, as it had done just before
the vehicle jolted away from the homestead. She could
once more see the wagon growing smaller and smaller on
the white prairie, until it dipped behind the crest of a low
hill, and the sinking beat of hoofs died away. Then, at
least, she had realized that he had started on the first stage
of a journey which might lead him through the ice-bound
gates of the North to the rest that awaits the souls of sailors.
She could not, however, imagine him shrinking from
any ordeal. Gripping helm, or hauling in the sled traces,
he would gaze with quiet eyes steadfastly ahead, even if he
saw only the passage from this world to the next. Once
more a curious thrill ran through her, and there was pride
as well as regret in it. Presently she became conscious
that Hastings was speaking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What took you around by the Range, Jim?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Collecting,&#8221; answered Sproatly. &#8220;I sold Gregory a
couple of binders earlier in the season, but I couldn&#8217;t get
a dollar out of him.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;Of course, if it had
been anybody else I&#8217;d have stayed until he handed over the
money, but I couldn&#8217;t press Gregory too hard after quartering
myself upon him as I did last winter, though I&#8217;m
rather afraid my employers wouldn&#8217;t appreciate that kind
of delicacy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings looked thoughtful. &#8220;Gregory should
have been able to pay. He thrashed out a moderately good
crop.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About two-thirds of what it should have been, and I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
reason for believing that he has been putting up a mortgage.
Interest&#8217;s heavy. There&#8217;s another matter. I wonder
if you&#8217;ve heard that he&#8217;s getting rid of two of Harry&#8217;s
hands? I mean Pat and Tom Moran.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure of that?&#8221; Hastings asked sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom told me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings leaned forward suddenly in her chair.
&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to drive across on Monday,
and have a few words with Gregory. Did Moran tell you
that Harry had decided to keep the two of them on
throughout the year?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t very explicit, but he seemed to feel he had
a grievance against Gregory. Of course, in a way, you
can&#8217;t blame Gregory. He&#8217;s in charge, and it isn&#8217;t in him
to carry out Harry&#8217;s policy. This fall in wheat is getting
on his nerves, and in any case he&#8217;d probably have held his
hand and cut down the crop next year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do blame him.&#8221; Mrs. Hastings turned to Agatha.
&#8220;You will understand that in a general way there&#8217;s not
much that can be done when the snow&#8217;s upon the ground,
and as one result of it the hired man prefers to engage
himself for the year. To secure himself from being
turned adrift when harvest is over he frequently makes a
concession in wages. Now I know Harry intended to keep
those two men on, and Tom Moran, who has a little half-cleared
ranch back somewhere in the bush of Ontario, came
out here tempted by higher wages. I understand he had
to raise a few dollars or give the place up, and he left his
wife behind. Many of the smaller ranch men can&#8217;t live
upon their holdings. Well, I&#8217;m going over on Monday to
tell Gregory he has got to keep these two men, and you&#8217;re
coming with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha made no reply. In the first place, she knew
that if Mrs. Hastings had made any plan she would gain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
nothing by objecting, and in addition to this she was conscious
of a certain desire to go. She felt that if Wyllard
had let the men understand that he would not dismiss them,
the promise, implied or explicit, must be redeemed. Wyllard
would not have attempted to release himself from it&mdash;she
was sure of that&mdash;and it appeared intolerable to her
that another man should be permitted to do anything that
would unfavorably reflect on him. Somewhat to her relief,
Hastings started another topic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have sold quite a few binders and harrows one
way or another, haven&#8217;t you, Jim?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Sproatly laughed. &#8220;I have,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;As I
told the Company&#8217;s Western representative some time ago,
a man who could sell patent medicine to the folks round
here could do a good trade in anything. He admitted that
my contention sounded reasonable, but I didn&#8217;t wear store
clothes then, and he seemed very far from sure of me.
Anyway, he gave me a show, and now I&#8217;ve got two or three
complimentary letters from the Company. They&#8217;ve added
a few dollars to my salary, and hint that it&#8217;s possible they
may put me in charge of an implement store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re satisfied?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sproatly, with an air of reflection, &#8220;in
some respects, I suppose I am. In others, the thing&#8217;s galling.
You have to report who you&#8217;ve called upon, and, if
you couldn&#8217;t do business, why they bought somebody else&#8217;s
machines. If you can&#8217;t get a farmer to take you in you
have to put up at a hotel. There&#8217;s no more camping in
a birch bluff under your wagon. Besides, you have to wear
store clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings glanced at Winifred, and Agatha fancied that
she understood what was in his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks would sooner sleep in a hotel,&#8221; he remarked,
with a twinkle in his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; declared Sproatly, &#8220;they don&#8217;t know very
much. They&#8217;re the kind of men who&#8217;d spend an hour every
morning putting their clothes on, and they haven&#8217;t found
out that there&#8217;s no comfort in any garment until you&#8217;ve
had to sew two or three flour bag patches on to it. Then
think of the splendid freeness of the other way of living.
You get your supper when you want it and just as you
like it. No tea tastes as good as the kind with the wood
smoke in it that you drink out of a blackened can. You
can hear the little birch leaves and the grasses whispering
about you when you lie down at night, and you drive on
in the glorious freshness&mdash;just when it pleases you&mdash;every
morning. Now the Company has the whole route and
programme plotted out for me. Their clerks write me
letters demanding most indelicately why I haven&#8217;t done
this and that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred looked at him disapprovingly. &#8220;Civilization,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;implies responsibility. You can&#8217;t live
just as you like without its being detrimental to the community.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; returned Sproatly with a rueful gesture, &#8220;it
implies no end of giving up. You have to fall into line,
and that&#8217;s why I kept outside it just as long as I could.
I don&#8217;t like standing in a rank, and,&#8221; he glanced down at
his cloth, &#8220;I&#8217;ve an inborn objection to wearing uniform.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha laughed as she caught Hastings&#8217; eye. She
guessed that Sproatly would be sorry for his candor afterwards,
but to some extent she understood what he was feeling.
It was a revolt against cramping customs and conventionalities,
and she partly sympathized with it, though
she knew that such revolts are dangerous. Even in the
West, those who cannot lead must march in column with
the rank and file or bear the consequences of their futile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
mutiny. It is a hard truth that no man can live as he
pleases.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Restraint,&#8221; asserted Winifred, &#8220;is a wholesome thing,
but it&#8217;s one most of the men I have met are singularly deficient
in. That&#8217;s why they can&#8217;t be left alone, but must
be driven, as they are, in companies. It&#8217;s their own fault
if they now and then find it a little humiliating.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a faint gleam in her eyes, at which Sproatly
apparently took warning, for he said no more upon that
subject, and they talked about other matters until he took
his departure an hour or two later. It was the next afternoon
when he appeared again and Mrs. Hastings smiled at
Agatha as he and Winifred drove away together.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty miles is a long way to drive in the frost. I
suppose you have noticed that she calls him Jim?&#8221; Mrs.
Hastings commented. &#8220;Anyway, there&#8217;s a good deal of
very genuine ability in that young man. He isn&#8217;t altogether
wild.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His appearance rather suggested it when I first met
him,&#8221; replied Agatha with a laugh. &#8220;Was it a pose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings reflectively. &#8220;I think one
could call it a reaction, and it&#8217;s probable that some very
worthy people in the Old Country are to blame for it.
Sproatly is not the only young man who has suffered from
having too many rules and conventions crammed down his
throat. In fact, they&#8217;re rather plentiful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha said nothing further, for the little girls appeared
just then, and it was not until the next afternoon that she
and Mrs. Hastings were again alone together. Then as
they drove across the prairie the older woman spoke of the
business they had in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory must keep those men,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
doubt that Harry meant to do it, and it would be horribly
unfair to turn them loose now when there is absolutely
nothing going on. Besides, Tom Moran is a man I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
specially sorry for. As I told you, he left a young wife
and a very little child behind him when he came out here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One would wonder why he did it,&#8221; responded Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had to. There seems to be a notion in the Old
Country that we earn our money easily, but it&#8217;s very wrong.
We&#8217;ll take that man&#8217;s case as an example. He has a little,
desolate holding up in the bush of Ontario, a hole chopped
out of the forest and studded all over with sawn-off fir-stumps.
On it is a little two-roomed log shack. In all
probability there isn&#8217;t a settlement within two or three
leagues of the spot. Now, as a rule, a place of that kind
won&#8217;t produce enough to keep a man for several years after
he has partially cleared it, and unless he can earn something
in the meanwhile he must give it up. Moran, it
seems, got heavily into debt with the nearest storekeeper,
and had to choose between selling the place or coming out
here where wages are higher. Well, you can probably imagine
what it must be to the woman who stayed behind in
the desolate bush, seeing nobody for weeks together, though
I&#8217;ve no doubt that she&#8217;d bear it uncomplainingly believing
that her husband would come back with enough to clear
the debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha could imagine the state of affairs in the little
home, and a certain indignation against Gregory crept into
her heart. She had once liked to think of him as pitiful
and chivalrous, and now, it seemed, he was quite willing
that this woman should make her sacrifice in vain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But why have you taken the trouble to impress this
on&mdash;me?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings smiled. &#8220;I want you to plead that
woman&#8217;s cause. Gregory may do what you ask him gracefully.
That would be much the nicest way out of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The nicest way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mrs. Hastings, &#8220;there is another one.
Gregory is going to keep Tom Moran, anyway. Harry has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
one or two friends in this neighborhood who feel it more
or less of an obligation on them to maintain his credit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha felt the blood rise to her face. It was an unpleasant
thing to admit, but she fancied that Gregory
might yield to judicious pressure when he would not be
influenced by either compassion or a sense of equity. It
flashed upon her that had Mrs. Hastings believed that she
still retained any tenderness for the man, the story of
Moran would not have been told to her. The whole situation
was horribly embarrassing, but Agatha had courage in
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she promised simply, &#8220;I will speak to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They said nothing more until they approached the
Range, and as they drove by the outbuildings Agatha
glanced about her curiously. It occurred to her that the
homestead did not look quite the same as it appeared when
Wyllard was there. A wagon without one wheel stood
near the straw pile. A door of the barn hung awkwardly
open in a manner which suggested that it needed mending,
and the snow had blown inside the building. In the side of
one sod and pole structure there was a gap which should
have been repaired. Several other things suggested slackness
and indifference. She saw Mrs. Hastings frown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a change in the place already,&#8221; said her
friend. They alighted in another minute or two, and
when they entered the house the gray-haired Swedish
woman greeted them moodily. She seemed to notice the
glance Mrs. Hastings cast around her, and her manner became
deprecatory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t keep things straight now. It is not the same,&#8221;
she complained.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings asked if Hawtrey was in, and hearing
that he was, turned to Agatha. &#8220;Go along and talk to
him. I&#8217;ve something to say to Mrs. Nansen,&#8221; she said.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE PRIOR CLAIM</h3>
</div>

<p>It was with confused feelings, among which a sense of
repugnance predominated, that Agatha walked toward
Hawtrey&#8217;s room. She was not one of the women who
take pleasure in pointing out another person&#8217;s duty, for,
while she had discovered that this task is apparently an
easy one to some people, she was aware that a duty usually
looks much more burdensome when it is laid upon one&#8217;s
self. Indeed, she was conscious just then that one might
be shortly thrust upon her, which she would find it very
hard to bear, and she became troubled with a certain compunction
as she remembered how she had of late persistently
driven all thought of it out of her mind.
</p>
<p>There was no doubt that she was still pledged to Gregory,
and that she had loved him once. Both facts had to
be admitted, and it seemed to her that if he insisted she
must marry him. Deep down in her there was an innate
sense of right and honesty, and she realized that the fact
that he was not the man she had once imagined him to be
did not release her. It was clear that, if he was about to
commit a cruel and unjustifiable action, she was the one
person of all others whose part it was to restrain him.
</p>
<p>The color was a little plainer in her face than usual when
she entered the room where he lay, pipe in hand, in a
lounge chair. His attitude of languid ease irritated her.
She had seen that there were several things outside which
should have had some claim on his attention. A litter of
letters and papers lay upon a little table at his side, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the fact that he could not reach them as he lay was suggestive.
He did not notice her entrance immediately.
He rose, when he saw her, and came forward with outstretched
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a pleasure I
scarcely anticipated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat down in the chair that he drew out for her
near the stove. He noticed that she glanced at the papers
on the table, and he laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bills, and things of that kind. They&#8217;ve been worrying
me for a week or two,&#8221; he said lightly. He seized the litter,
and bundling it together flung it into an open drawer,
which he shut with a snap. &#8220;Anyway, that&#8217;s the last of
them for to-day. I&#8217;m awfully glad you drove over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled. The action was so characteristic of the
man. She had once found no fault with Gregory&#8217;s careless
habits, and his way of thrusting a difficulty into the background
had appealed to her. It had suggested his ability
to straighten out the trouble when it appeared advisable.
Now she told herself that she would not be absurdly hypercritical,
and, as it happened, he had given her the lead that
she desired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think that you would have had to give them
more attention as wheat is going down,&#8221; she remarked.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey looked at her with an air of reproach. &#8220;It
must be nearly three weeks since I have seen you, and now
you expect me to talk of farming.&#8221; He made a rueful
gesture. &#8220;If you quite realized the situation it would be
about the last thing you would ask me to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was astonished to remember that three weeks
had actually elapsed since she had last met him, and they
had only exchanged a word or two then. He had certainly
not obtruded himself upon her, for which she was grateful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is talking about anything except the fall in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
prices just now,&#8221; she persisted. &#8220;I suppose it affects you,
too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregory, who seemed to accept this as a rebuff, looked
at her rather curiously, and then laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be admitted that it does. In fact, I&#8217;ve been
acquiring parsimonious habits and worrying myself about
expenses lately. The expenses have to be kept down somehow,
and that&#8217;s a kind of thing I never took kindly to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel it a greater responsibility when you&#8217;re managing
somebody else&#8217;s affairs?&#8221; suggested Agatha, who was
still awaiting her opportunity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Hawtrey, in whom there was, after all,
a certain honesty, &#8220;that&#8217;s not quite the only thing that has
some weight with me. You see, I&#8217;m not altogether disinterested.
I get a certain percentage&mdash;on the margin&mdash;after
everything is paid, and I want it to be a big one.
Things are rather tight just now, and the wretched mortgage
on my place is crippling me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It had slipped out before he quite realized what he was
saying, and he saw the girl&#8217;s look of concern. She now
realized what Sproatly had meant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in debt, Gregory? I thought you had, at
least, kept clear of that,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So I did&mdash;for a while. In any case, if Wyllard stays
away, and I can run this place on the right lines, I shall,
no doubt, get out of it again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was vexed that he should speak so selfishly, for it
was clear to her that, if Wyllard did not return until another
crop was gathered in, it would be because he was
held fast among the Northern ice in peril of his life. Then
another thought struck her. She had never quite understood
why Gregory had been willing to undertake the management
of the Range. In view of the probability that
Wyllard had plainly told him what to expect concerning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
herself, she had been greatly puzzled by his acquiescence.
But he had made that point clear by admitting that he had
been burdened with a load of debt. But why had he incurred
debts? The answer came to her as she remembered
having heard Mrs. Hastings or somebody else say that he
had spent a great deal of money upon his house and the
furnishings for it. It brought her a sudden sense of confusion,
for as one result of that expenditure he had been
forced into doing what she fancied must have been a very
repugnant thing. And she had never even crossed his
threshold!
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you borrow that money?&#8221; she asked
sharply.
</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Gregory was embarrassed, and
her heart softened toward him for his hesitation. It was
to further her comfort that he had laid that load upon
himself, and he was clearly unwilling that she should know
it. That counted for much in her favor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it just before I came out?&#8221; she asked again.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey made a little sign of expostulation. &#8220;You
really mustn&#8217;t worry me about these matters, Aggy. A
good many of us are in the storekeepers&#8217; or mortgage-jobbers&#8217;
hands, and there&#8217;s no doubt that if I have another
good year at the Range I shall clear off the debt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha turned her face away from him for a moment or
two. The thing that Gregory had done laid a heavy obligation
on her, and she remembered that she had only found
fault with him! Even then, stirred as she was, she was
conscious that all the tenderness that she had once felt for
him had vanished. The duty, however, remained, and
with a little effort she turned to him again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey smiled. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t think I deserve a very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
great deal of pity. As I have said, I&#8217;ll probably come out
all right next year if I can only keep expenses down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Agatha remembered the task that she had in hand.
It was a very inauspicious moment to set about it, but
that could not be helped, and even for Gregory&#8217;s own sake
she felt that she must win him over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one way, Gregory, in which I don&#8217;t think it
ought to be done,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You assumed Mr. Wyllard&#8217;s
obligations when you took the farm, and I think you
should keep the two Morans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey started. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Mrs. Hastings
has been setting you on; I partly expected it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me,&#8221; Agatha admitted. &#8220;Unless you will
look at the thing as I do, I could almost wish she hadn&#8217;t.
The thought of that man&#8217;s wife shut up in the woods all
winter only to find that what she has had to bear has all
been thrown away troubles me. Now Wyllard promised to
keep those men on, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no regular engagement so far as I can make
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, Moran seems to have understood that he was to
be kept on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Hawtrey, &#8220;he evidently does. If the
market had gone with us I&#8217;d have fallen in with his views.
As it hasn&#8217;t, every man&#8217;s wages count.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was conscious of a little thrill of repugnance.
Of late Gregory&#8217;s ideas had frequently jarred on her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that release you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey did not answer this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep those men on if you want me to,&#8221; he promised.
</p>
<p>Agatha winced at this. She had discovered that she
must not look for too much from Gregory, but to realize
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
that he had practically no sense of moral obligation, and
could be influenced to do justice only by the expectation
of obtaining her favor positively hurt her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want them kept on, but I don&#8217;t want you to do it for
that reason,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you grasp the distinction,
Gregory?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A trace of darker color dyed Hawtrey&#8217;s face, but while
she was a little surprised at the evidence that he felt her
rebuke, he looked at her steadily. He had not thought
much about her during the last month, but now the faint
scorn in her voice aroused his resentment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there are just three reasons, Aggy,
why you should have troubled yourself about this thing.
You are, perhaps, a little sorry for Moran&#8217;s wife, but as
you haven&#8217;t even seen her that can hardly count for much.
The next is, that you don&#8217;t care to see me doing what you
regard as a shabby thing; perhaps it is a shabby thing in
some respects, but I feel it&#8217;s justifiable. Of course, if
that&#8217;s your reason there&#8217;s a sense in which, while not exactly
complimentary&mdash;it&#8217;s consoling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, and looked at her with a question in his
eyes, and it cost Agatha an effort to meet his. She was
not prudish or overconscious of her own righteousness,
but once or twice, after the shock of her disillusionment
in regard to him had lessened, she had dreamed of the possibility
of endowing him little by little with some of the
qualities she had once fancied he possessed, and, as she
vaguely thought of it, rehabilitating him. Now, however,
the thing seemed impossible, and, what was more, the desire
to bring it about had gone. Hateful as the situation
was becoming, she was honest, and she could not let him
credit her with a motive that had not influenced her.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, her very coldness and aloofness stirred
desire in the man, and she shrank as she saw a spark of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
passion kindling in his eyes. She recognized that there
was a strain of grossness in him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;that reason was not one which
had any weight with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;Then,&#8221; he said grimly,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll get on to the third. Wyllard&#8217;s credit is a precious
thing to you; sooner than anything should cast a stain on
it you would beg a favor from&mdash;me. You have set him up
on a pedestal, and it would hurt you if he came down. Considering
everything, it&#8217;s a remarkably curious situation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha grew pale. Gregory was horribly right, for she
had no doubt now that he had merely thrust upon her a
somewhat distressing truth. It was to save Wyllard&#8217;s
credit, and for that alone, that she had undertaken this
most unpleasant task. She did not answer, and Hawtrey
stood up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wyllard has his faults, but there&#8217;s this in his favor&mdash;he
keeps a promise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One has a certain respect
for a person who never goes back upon his word. Well, because
I really think he would like it, I&#8217;ll keep those men.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, as if to let her grasp the drift
of his words, and then turned to her with something that
startled her in his voice and manner. &#8220;The question is&mdash;are
you willing to emulate his example?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha shrank from the glow in his eyes. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she
broke out, &#8220;you cannot urge me now&mdash;after what you
said.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed harshly. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come
for my answer very shortly. It seems that you and Wyllard
attach a great deal of importance to a moral obligation&mdash;and
I must remind you that the time agreed upon is
almost up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat very still for perhaps half a minute, while a
sense of dismay took possession of her. There was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
doubt that Gregory&#8217;s retort was fully warranted. She
had insisted upon his carrying out an obligation which
would cost him something, not because she took pleasure in
seeing him do what was honorable, but to preserve the
credit of another man. And now it was with intense repugnance
that she recognized that there was apparently no
escaping from the obligation she had incurred. Gregory&#8217;s
attitude was perfectly natural and logical. She had promised
to marry him, and he had saddled himself with a load
of debt on her account, but the slight pity and tenderness
that she had felt for him a few minutes earlier had utterly
disappeared. Indeed, she felt that she almost hated him.
His face had grown hard and almost brutal, and there was
a look she shrank from in his eyes.
</p>
<p>She rose with trembling limbs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish to speak to Mrs. Hastings?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey&#8217;s lip curled. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if she&#8217;ll excuse
me, I don&#8217;t think I do. If you tell her you have been successful,
she&#8217;ll probably be quite content.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha went out without another word. Hawtrey
lighted his pipe and stretched himself out in his chair,
when he heard the wagon drive away a few minutes later.
He did not like Mrs. Hastings, and had a suspicion that
she had no great regard for him, but he was conscious of a
grim satisfaction. There was, though it seldom came to
the surface, a current of crude brutality in his nature, and
it was active now. When Agatha had first come from
England the change in her had been a shock to him, and
it would not have cost him very much to let her go. Since
then, however, her coldness and half-perceived disdain had
angered him, and the interview which was just past had
left him in an unpleasant mood. Though it was, perhaps,
the last effect he would have expected, it had stirred him
to desire a fulfillment of her pledge. It was consoling to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
feel that he could exact the keeping of her promise. His
face grew coarser as he assured himself of his claim, but
he had never realized the shiftiness and instability of his
own character. It was his misfortune that the impulses
which swayed him one day had generally changed the next.
</p>
<p>This became apparent when, having occasion to drive in
to the elevators on the railroad a week later, he called at a
store to make one or two purchases. The man who kept
the store laid a package on the counter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you&#8217;d take this along to Miss Creighton as
a favor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She wrote for the things, and Elliot
was to take them out, but I guess he forgot. Anyway, he
didn&#8217;t call.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey told the clerk to put the package in his wagon.
He had scarcely seen Sally since his recovery, and he suddenly
remembered that, after all, he owed her a good deal,
and that she was very pretty. Besides, one could talk to
Sally without feeling the restraint that Agatha&#8217;s manner
usually laid on him.
</p>
<p>The storekeeper laid an open box upon the counter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re going to be married by and by,&#8221; he said.
Hawtrey was thinking of Sally then, and the question irritated
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that it concerns you, but in a general
way it&#8217;s probable,&#8221; he replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the storekeeper good-humoredly, &#8220;a pair
of these mittens would make quite a nice present for a lady.
Smartest thing of the kind I&#8217;ve ever seen here; choicest
Alaska fur.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey bought a pair, and the storekeeper took a fur
cap out of another box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is just the thing she&#8217;d like to go
with the mittens. There&#8217;s style about that cap; feel the
gloss of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>Hawtrey bought the cap, and smiled as he swung himself
up into his wagon. Gloves are not much use in the prairie
frost, and mittens, which are not divided into fingerstalls,
will within limits fit almost anybody. This, he felt,
was fortunate, for he was not quite sure that he meant to
give them to Agatha.
</p>
<p>It was bitterly cold, and the pace the team made was
slow, for the snow was loose and too thin for a sled of any
kind. Night had closed down and Hawtrey was suffering
from the cold, when at last a birch bluff rose out of the
waste in front of him. It cut black against the cold blueness
of the sky and the spectral gleam of snow, but when
he had driven a little further a stream of ruddy orange
light appeared in the midst of it. A few minutes later he
pulled his team up in front of a little log-built house, and
getting down with difficulty saw the door open as he approached
it. Sally stood in the entrance silhouetted against
a blaze of cheerful light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Gregory!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey recognized the thrill in her voice, and took both
her hands, as he had once been in the habit of doing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you let me in?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>The girl laughed in a strained fashion. She had been a
little startled, and was not quite sure yet as to how she
should receive him; but Hawtrey drew her in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The old folks are out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve gone over
to Elliot&#8217;s for supper. He&#8217;s bringing us a package.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey, who explained that he had the parcel, let her
hands go, and sat down somewhat limply. He had come
suddenly out of the bitter frost into the little, brightly-lighted,
stove-warmed room. The comfort and cheeriness
of it appealed to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks very cozy after my desolate room at the
Range,&#8221; he remarked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you&#8217;ll stay I&#8217;ll cook you supper. I suppose
there&#8217;s nothing to take you home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared Hawtrey with a significant glance at
her, &#8220;there certainly isn&#8217;t, Sally. As a matter of fact, I
often wish there was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw her sudden uncertainty, which was, however, not
tinged with embarrassment, and feeling that he had gone
far enough he went out to put up his team. When he returned
there was a cloth on the table, and Sally was busy
about the stove. He sat down and watched her attentively.
In some respects, he thought she compared favorably
with Agatha. She had a nicely molded figure, and
a curious lithe gracefulness of carriage which was suggestive
of a strong vitality. Agatha&#8217;s bearing was usually
characterized by a certain frigid repose. Then Sally&#8217;s
face was at least as comely as Agatha&#8217;s, though attractive
in a different way, and there was no reserve in it. Sally
was what he thought of as human, frankly flesh and blood.
Her quick smile was, as a rule, provocative, and never
chilled one as Agatha&#8217;s quiet glances sometimes did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ve grown prettier than ever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl turned partly towards him with a slow, sinuous
movement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she replied quickly, &#8220;you oughtn&#8217;t to say those
things to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed; he was usually sure of his ground
with Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I, when I&#8217;m telling the truth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, Miss Ismay wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregory&#8217;s face hardened. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure she&#8217;d mind.
Anyway, Miss Ismay doesn&#8217;t like many things I&#8217;m in the
habit of doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally, who had watched him closely, turned away again,
but a thrill of exultation ran through her. It had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
with dismay she had first heard him speak of his marriage,
and she had fled home in an agony of anger and humiliation.
That state of mind, however, had not lasted long,
and when it became evident that the wedding was postponed
indefinitely, she began to wonder whether it was
quite impossible that Hawtrey should come back to her.
She felt that he belonged to her, although he had never
given her any very definite claim on him. She was primitive
and passionate, but she was determined, and now that
he had done what she had almost expected him to do, she
meant to keep him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have fallen out?&#8221; she inquired, and contrived to
keep the anxiety that she was conscious of out of her voice.
</p>
<p>The question, and more particularly the form of it,
jarred upon Hawtrey, but he answered it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a matter of fact, Sally, you
can&#8217;t fall out nicely with everybody. Now when we fell
out you got delightfully angry&mdash;I don&#8217;t know whether you
were more delightful then or when you graciously agreed
to make it up again.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;I almost wish I
could make you a little angry now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally had moved nearer him to take a kettle off the stove,
and she looked down on him with her eyes shining in the
lamplight. She realized that she would have to fight Miss
Ismay for the man; but there was this in her favor&mdash;that
she appealed directly to one side of his nature, as Agatha,
even if she had loved him, could not have attracted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Dare you try?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might if I was tempted sufficiently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She leaned upon the table still looking at him mockingly,
and she was probably aware that her pose and expression
challenged him. Indeed, she could not have
failed to recognize the meaning of the sudden tightening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
of his lips, though she did not in the least shrink from it.
She had not the faintest doubt of her ability to keep him
at a due distance if it appeared necessary.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she taunted, &#8220;you only say things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed, and stooping down packed up a package
he had brought from the store.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;after all, I think I&#8217;d rather try
to please you.&#8221; He opened the package. &#8220;Are these
things very much too big for you, Sally?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes glistened at the sight of the mittens he
held out. They were very different from the kind she had
been in the habit of wearing, and when he carelessly took
out the fur cap she broke into a little cry of delight. Hawtrey
watched her with a curious expression. He was not
quite sure that he had meant Sally to have the things when
he had purchased them, but he was quite contented now.
The one gift he had diffidently offered Agatha since her
arrival in Canada had been almost coldly laid aside.
</p>
<p>In a few minutes Sally laid out supper, and as she waited
upon him daintily or filled his cup Hawtrey thrust the
misgivings he had felt further behind him. Sally, he
thought with a feeling of satisfaction, could certainly cook.
When the meal was finished he sat talking about nothing
in particular for almost an hour, and then it occurred to
him that Sally&#8217;s mother would be back before very long.
She was a person he had no great liking for and he was
anxious to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must be getting home. Won&#8217;t you
let me see you with that cap on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally, who betrayed no diffidence, put on the cap, and
stood before a dingy mirror with both hands raised while
she pressed it down upon her gleaming hair. She flashed
a smiling glance at him. It was quite sufficient, and as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
she turned again Hawtrey slipped forward as softly as he
could. She swung around, however, with a flush in her
face and a forceful restraining gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil it all, Gregory,&#8221; she said sharply.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey, who saw that she meant it&mdash;which was a cause
of some astonishment to him&mdash;dropped his arms that were
held out to embrace her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you look at it in that way I&#8217;m sorry.
Good-night, Sally!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She let him go, but she smiled when he drove away;
and half an hour later she showed the cap and mittens
to her mother with significant candor. Mrs. Creighton,
who was a severely practical person, nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he only wants a little managing if
he bought you these, and nobody could say you ran after
him.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST STAKE</h3>
</div>

<p>A fortnight had slipped by since the evening Hawtrey
had spent with Sally, when Winifred and Sproatly once
more arrived at the Hastings homestead. The girl was
looking jaded, and it appeared that the manager of the
elevator, who had all along treated her with a great deal
of consideration, had insisted upon her going away for a
few days when the pressure of business which had followed
the harvest had slackened. Sproatly, as usual, had driven
her in from the settlement.
</p>
<p>When the evening meal was finished they drew their
chairs close up about the stove, and Hastings thrust fresh
birch billets into it, for there was a bitter frost. Mrs.
Hastings installed Winifred in a canvas lounge and
wrapped a shawl about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t got warm yet, and you&#8217;re looking quite
worn out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suppose Hamilton has still been
keeping you at work until late at night?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been very busy since I was last here,&#8221; Winifred
admitted, and then turned to Hastings. &#8220;Until the
last week or so there has been no slackening in the rush to
sell. Everybody seems to have been throwing wheat on to
the market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings looked thoughtful. &#8220;A good many of the
smaller men have been doing so, but I think they&#8217;re foolish.
They&#8217;re only helping to break down prices, and I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder if one or two of the big, long-headed buyers
saw their opportunity in the temporary panic. In fact,
if I&#8217;d a pile of money lying in the bank I&#8217;m not sure that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
I wouldn&#8217;t send along a buying order and operate for a
rise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings shook her head at him. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said;
&#8220;you certainly wouldn&#8217;t while I had any say in the matter.
You&#8217;re rather a good farmer, but I haven&#8217;t met one yet who
made a successful speculator. Some of our friends have
tried it&mdash;and you know where it landed them. I expect
those broker and mortgage men must lick their lips when
a nice fat woolly farmer comes along. It must be quite
delightful to shear him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings laughed. &#8220;I should like to point out that
most of the farmers in this country are decidedly thin, and
have uncommonly little wool on them.&#8221; Then he turned
to the others. &#8220;I feel inclined to tell you how Mrs. Hastings
made the expenses of her Paris trip; it&#8217;s an example
of feminine consistency. She went around the neighborhood
and bought up all the wheat anybody had left on
hand, or, at least, she made me do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings, who had means of her own, nodded.
&#8220;That was different,&#8221; she declared; &#8220;anyway, I had the
wheat, and I&mdash;knew&mdash;it would go up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why shouldn&#8217;t other folks sell forward, for instance,
when they know it will go down? That&#8217;s not what
I suggested doing, but the point&#8217;s the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t got the wheat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course; they wouldn&#8217;t operate for a fall if they had.
On the other hand, if their anticipations proved correct,
they could buy it for less than they sold at before they had
to deliver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; asserted Mrs. Hastings severely, &#8220;is pure gambling.
It&#8217;s sure to land one in the hands of the mortgage
jobber.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings smiled at the others. &#8220;As a matter of fact, it
not infrequently does, but I want you to note the subtle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
distinction. The thing&#8217;s quite legitimate if you&#8217;ve only
got the wheat in a bag. In such a case you must naturally
operate for a rise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good deal to be said for that point of view,&#8221;
observed Sproatly. &#8220;You can keep the wheat if you&#8217;re
not satisfied, but when you try the other plan the margin
that may vanish at any moment is the danger. I suppose
Gregory has still been selling the Range wheat, Winifred?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe we have sent on every bushel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly exchanged a significant glance with Hastings,
whose face once more grew thoughtful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; remarked Hastings, &#8220;if he&#8217;s wise he&#8217;ll stop
at that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings changed the subject, and drew her chair
closer in to the stove, which snapped and crackled cheerfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a lot colder where Harry is,&#8221; she said with
a shiver.
</p>
<p>She flashed a swift glance at Agatha, and saw the girl&#8217;s
expression change, but Sproatly broke in again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was bad enough driving in from the railroad this
afternoon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Winifred was almost frozen. That
is why I didn&#8217;t go round for the pattern mat&mdash;I think
that&#8217;s what Creighton said it was&mdash;Mrs. Creighton borrowed
from you. I met him at the settlement a day or
two ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings said that he could bring it another time,
and while the rest talked of something else Winifred
turned to Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It really was horribly cold, and I almost fancied one
of my hands was frost-nipped,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As it happens,
I can&#8217;t buy mittens like your new ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My new ones?&#8221; questioned Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The ones Gregory bought you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Agatha laughed. &#8220;My dear, he never gave me any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred looked puzzled. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she persisted, &#8220;he
certainly bought them, and a fur cap, too. I was in the
store when he did it, though I don&#8217;t think he noticed me.
They were lovely mittens&mdash;such a pretty brown fur.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. Hastings, unobserved by either of them,
looked up and caught Sproatly&#8217;s eye. His face became
suddenly expressionless, and he looked away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221; Agatha asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fortnight ago, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat silent, and was glad when Mrs. Hastings
asked Winifred a question. She desired no gifts from
Gregory, but since he had bought the cap and mittens she
wondered what he could have done with them. It was
disconcerting to feel that, while he evidently meant to hold
her to her promise, he must have given them to somebody
else. She had never heard of his acquaintance with Sally
Creighton, but it struck her as curious that although the
six months&#8217; delay he had granted her had lately expired,
he had neither sent her any word nor called at the homestead.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later Mrs. Hastings took up a basket of
sewing and moved towards the door. Sproatly, who rose
as she approached him, drew aside his chair, and she
handed the basket to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can carry it if you like,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Sproatly took the basket, and followed her into another
room, where he sat it down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said, with a twinkle in his eyes.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings regarded him thoughtfully. &#8220;I wonder
if you know what Gregory did with those mittens?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rather pleased that I can assure that I don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you imagine that he kept them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t an opinion on that point.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Still, if I said that I felt certain he had given them
to somebody you would have some idea as to who it would
probably be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; confessed Sproatly reluctantly, &#8220;if you insist
upon it, I must admit that I could make a guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings smiled in a manner which suggested comprehension.
&#8220;So could I,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if we both guessed right. Now you may as well go
back to the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly, who made no answer, turned away, and he was
talking to Agatha when, half an hour later, a wagon drew
up outside the door. In another minute or two he leaned
forward in amused expectation as Sally walked into the
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going on to Lander&#8217;s, and just called to bring back
the mat you lent us,&#8221; she said to Mrs. Hastings. &#8220;Sproatly
was to have come for it, but he didn&#8217;t?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly, who said he was sorry, fixed his eyes on her.
It was clear to him that Agatha did not understand the
situation, but he fancied that Sally was filled with an almost
belligerent satisfaction. She was wearing a smart
fur cap, and in one hand she carried a pair of new fur
mittens which she had just taken off. Sproatly, who
glanced at them, noticed that Winifred did the same.
Then Mrs. Hastings spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you have met Miss Ismay, Sally,&#8221; she
said.
</p>
<p>Sally merely acknowledged that she had not been introduced,
and Sproatly became more sure that the situation
was an interesting one, when Mrs. Hastings formally presented
her. It was clear to him that Agatha was somewhat
puzzled by Sally&#8217;s attitude.
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Agatha, who said that she must have
had a cold drive, was regarding the new arrival with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
curiosity that she had not expected to feel when the girl
first came in. Miss Creighton, she admitted, was comely,
though she was clearly somewhat primitive and crude.
The long skin coat she wore hid her figure, but her pose
was too virile; and there was a look which mystified Agatha
in her eyes. It was almost openly hostile, and there
was a suggestion of triumph in it. Agatha, who could
find no possible reason for this, resented it.
</p>
<p>Sally had remained standing, and, as she said nothing
further, there was an awkward silence. She was the dominant
figure in the room, and the others became sensible of
a slight constraint and embarrassment as she gazed at
Agatha with unwavering eyes. In fact, it was rather a relief
to them when at last she turned to Mrs. Hastings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop. It wouldn&#8217;t do to leave the team in this
frost,&#8221; said she.
</p>
<p>This was so evident that they let her go, and Mrs. Hastings,
who went with her to the door, afterwards sat down
beside Sproatly a little apart from the rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt you noticed those mittens,&#8221; she commented
softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; Sproatly admitted. &#8220;I think you can rely
upon my discretion. If you hadn&#8217;t wanted this assurance
I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;d have said anything upon the
subject. It, however, seems very probable that Winifred
noticed them, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean you&#8217;re not sure that Winifred&#8217;s discretion
is equal to your own?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;In this particular case the
trouble is that she&#8217;s animated by a sincere attachment to
Miss Ismay, and has, I understand, a rather poor opinion
of Gregory. Of course, I don&#8217;t know how far your views
on that point coincide with hers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect me to explain them to you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Sproatly, &#8220;I&#8217;m only anxious to keep
out of the thing. Gregory is a friend of mine, and, after
all, he has his strong points. I should, however, like to
mention that Winifred&#8217;s expression suggests that she&#8217;s
thinking of something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings smiled. &#8220;Then I must endeavor to have
a word or two with her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She left him with this, and not long afterwards she and
Winifred went out together. When the others were retiring
she detained Agatha for a minute or two in the empty
room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t the six months Gregory gave you run out
yet?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Agatha said they had, but she spoke in a careless tone
and it was evident that she had attached no particular
significance to the fact that Sally had worn a new fur cap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t been over to see you since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl, who admitted it, looked troubled. Mrs. Hastings
laid a hand upon her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if he does come you must put
him off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Agatha asked, in a low, strained voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing, because we want to keep you.&#8221; Mrs.
Hastings looked at her with a very friendly smile. &#8220;Are
you very anxious to make it up with Gregory?&#8221; A shiver
ran through the girl. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;I can&#8217;t answer
you that! I must do what is right!&#8221;
</p>
<p>To her astonishment, Mrs. Hastings drew her a little
nearer, stooped and kissed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of us, I believe, have that wish, but the thing is
often horribly complex,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Anyway, you must
put Gregory off again, if it&#8217;s only for another month or
two. I fancy you will not find it difficult.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned away, thus ending the conversation, but her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
manner had been so significant that Agatha, who did not
sleep well that night, decided, if it was possible, to act on
the well-meant advice.
</p>
<p>It happened that a little dapper man who was largely
interested in the land agency and general mortgage business
spent that evening with Hawtrey in Wyllard&#8217;s room
at the Range. He had driven around by Hawtrey&#8217;s homestead
earlier in the afternoon, and had deduced a good deal
from the state of it, though this was a point he kept to
himself. Now he lay on a lounge chair beside the stove
smoking one of Wyllard&#8217;s cigars and unobtrusively watching
his companion. There was a roll of bills in his pocket
with which Gregory had very reluctantly parted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of the fall in wheat it must have been rather a
pull for you to pay me that interest,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly was,&#8221; Hawtrey admitted with a rueful
smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry it had to be done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see how you made it,&#8221; persisted the other
man. &#8220;What you got for your wheat couldn&#8217;t have done
much more than cover working expenses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed. He was quite aware that his visitor&#8217;s
profession was not one that was regarded with any great
favor by the prairie farmers, but he was never particularly
cautious, and he rather liked the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, it didn&#8217;t, Edmonds,&#8221; he confessed.
&#8220;You see, I practically paid you out of what I get for running
this place. The red wheat Wyllard raises generally
commands a cent or two a bushel more from the big milling
people than anything put on the market round here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds made a sign of agreement. He had without
directly requesting him to do so led Hawtrey into showing
him around the Range that afternoon, and having of necessity
a practical knowledge of farming he had been impressed
by all that he had noticed. The farm, which was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
a big one, had evidently been ably managed until a recent
date, and he felt the strongest desire to get his hands on
it. This, as he knew, would have been out of the question
had Wyllard been at home, but with Hawtrey, upon whom
he had a certain hold, in charge, the thing appeared by no
means impossible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I suppose he was reasonably
liberal over your salary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get one. I take a share of the margin after
everything is paid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds carefully noted this. He was not sure that
such an arrangement would warrant one in regarding
Hawtrey as Wyllard&#8217;s partner, but he meant to gather a
little more information upon that point.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If wheat keeps on dropping there won&#8217;t be any margin
at all next year, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m inclined to figure on,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;There are, however, ways a man with nerve
could turn it to account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean by selling wheat down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Edmonds, &#8220;that&#8217;s just what I mean. Of
course, there is a certain hazard in the thing. You can
never be quite sure how the market will go, but the signs
everywhere point to still cheaper wheat next year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your view?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds smiled, and took out of his pocket a little bundle
of market reports.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Other folks seem to share it in Winnipeg, Chicago,
New York, and Liverpool. You can&#8217;t get behind these
stock statistics, though, of course, dead low prices are apt
to cut the output.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey read the reports with evident interest. All
were in the same pessimistic strain, and he could not know
that the money-lender had carefully selected them with a
view to the effect he hoped to produce. Edmonds, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
saw the interest in Hawtrey&#8217;s eyes, leaned towards him
confidentially when he spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind admitting that I&#8217;m taking a hand in a
big bear operation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather outside my
usual business, but the thing looks almost certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey glanced at him with a gleam in his eyes. There
was no doubt that the prospect of acquiring money by an
easier method than toiling in the rain and wind appealed
to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s good enough for you it should be safe,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;The trouble is that I&#8217;ve nothing to put in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not empowered to lay out Wyllard&#8217;s
money. If that was the case it shouldn&#8217;t be difficult to
pile up a bigger margin than you&#8217;re likely to do by farming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey started, for the idea had already crept into his
mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a way, I am, but I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;m warranted
in operating on the market with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you the arrangement you made with him in
writing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey opened a drawer, and Edmonds betrayed no
sign of the satisfaction he felt when he was handed an informally
worded document. He perused it carefully, and
it seemed to him that it constituted Hawtrey a partner in
the Range, which was satisfactory. He looked up thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;while I naturally can&#8217;t tell what
Wyllard contemplated, this paper certainly gives you power
to do anything you think advisable with his money. In
any case, I understand that he can&#8217;t be back until well on
in next year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t expect him until late in the summer, anyway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>There was silence for a moment or two, and during it
Hawtrey&#8217;s face grew set. It was unpleasant to look forward
to the time when he would be required to relinquish
the charge of the Range, and of late he had been wondering
how he could make the most of the situation. Then
Edmonds spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost certain that the operation I suggested can
result only one way, and it appears most unlikely that Wyllard
would raise any trouble if you handed him several
thousand dollars over and above what you had made by
farming. I can&#8217;t imagine a man objecting to that kind
of thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey sat still with indecision in his eyes for half a
minute, and Edmonds, who was too wise to say anything,
leaned back in his chair. Then Hawtrey turned to the
drawer again with an air of sudden resolution.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a check for a couple of thousand dollars,
which is as far as I care to go just now,&#8221; he announced
with studied carelessness.
</p>
<p>He took a pen, and Edmonds watched him with quiet
amusement as he wrote. As a matter of fact, Hawtrey
was in one respect, at least, perfectly safe in entrusting
the money to him. Edmonds had deprived a good many
prairie farmers of their possessions in his time, but he
never stooped to any crude trickery. He left that to the
smaller fry. Just then he was playing a deep and cleverly
thought-out game.
</p>
<p>He pocketed the check that Hawtrey gave him, and then
discussed other subjects for half an hour or so before he
rose to go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might ask them to get my team out. I&#8217;ve some
business at Lander&#8217;s and have ordered a room there,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send you a line when there&#8217;s any change in
the market.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>GREGORY MAKES UP HIS MIND</h3>
</div>

<p>Wheat was still being flung on to a lifeless market when
Hawtrey walked out of the mortgage jobber&#8217;s place of
business in the railroad settlement one bitter afternoon.
He had a big roll of paper money in his pocket, and was
feeling particularly pleased with himself, for prices had
steadily fallen since he had joined in the bear operation
Edmonds had suggested, and the result of it had proved
eminently satisfactory. This was why he had just given
Edmonds a further draft on Wyllard&#8217;s bank, with instructions
to sell wheat down on a more extensive scale. He
meant to operate in earnest now, which was exactly what
the broker had anticipated, but in this case Edmonds had
decided to let Hawtrey operate alone. Indeed, being an
astute and far-seeing man, the broker had gone so far as
to hint that caution might be advisable, though he had at
the same time been careful to show Hawtrey only those
market reports which had a distinctly pessimistic tone.
Edmonds was rather disposed to agree with the men who
looked forward to a reaction before very long.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey glanced about him as he strode down the street.
It was wholly unpaved, and deeply rutted, but the drifted
snow had partly filled the hollows, and it did not look very
much rougher than it would have appeared if somebody
had recently driven a plow through it. Along both sides
of it ran a rude plank sidewalk, raised a foot or two above
the ground, so that foot-passengers might escape the mire
of the thaw in spring. Immediately behind the sidewalk
squat, weatherbeaten, frame houses, all of much the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
pattern, rose abruptly. On some of the houses the fronts,
carried up as high as the ridge of the shingled roof, had
an unpleasantly square appearance. Here and there a dilapidated
wagon stood with lowered pole before a store, but
it was a particularly bitter afternoon, and there was nobody
out of doors. The place looked desolate and forlorn, with
a leaden sky hanging over it and an icy wind sweeping
through the streets.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey strode along briskly until he reached the open
space which divided the little wooden town from the unfenced
railroad track. It was strewn with fine dusty snow,
and the huge bulk of the grain elevators towered high
above it against the lowering sky. A freight locomotive
was just hauling a long string of wheat cars out of a sidetrack.
The locomotive stopped presently, and though
Hawtrey could not see anything beyond the big cars, he
knew by the shouts which broke out that something unusual
was going on. He was expecting Sally, who was
going east to Brandon by a train due in an hour or two.
</p>
<p>When the shouts grew a little louder he walked around
in front of the locomotive, which stood still with the steam
blowing noisily from a valve, and he saw the cause of the
commotion. A pair of vicious, half-broken bronchos were
backing a light wagon away from the locomotive on the
other side of the track, and a fur-wrapped figure sat stiffly
on the driving seat. Hawtrey called out and ran suddenly
forward as he saw that it was Sally who was in peril.
</p>
<p>Just then one of the horses lifted its fore hoofs off the
ground, and being jerked back by the pole plunged and
kicked furiously, until the other horse flung up its head
and the wagon went backward with a run. Then they
stopped, and there was a series of resounding crashes
against the front of the vehicle. Hawtrey was within a
pace or two of the wagon when Sally recognized him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep off,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;you can&#8217;t lead them! They
don&#8217;t want to cross the track, but they&#8217;ve got to if I pull
the jaws off them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was more forcible than elegant, and the shrill
harshness of the girl&#8217;s voice jarred upon Hawtrey, though
he was getting accustomed to Sally&#8217;s phraseology. He
understood that she would not have his help, even if it
would have been of much avail, which was doubtful, and
he reluctantly moved back toward the group of loungers
who were watching her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve no call to worry about her,&#8221; said one of
the men. &#8220;She&#8217;s holding them on the lowest notch, and
it&#8217;s a mighty powerful bit fixing. Besides, that girl could
drive anything that goes on four legs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said one of the others. &#8220;She&#8217;s a daisy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey was annoyed to notice that in place of being
embarrassed Sally evidently rather enjoyed the situation,
though several of the freight-train and station hands had
now joined the group of loungers and were cheering her
on. He had already satisfied himself that she had not a
trace of fear. In another moment or two, however, he forgot
his slight sense of disapproval, for Sally, sitting tense
and strung up on the driving seat with a glow in her
cheeks and a snap in her eyes, was wholly admirable.
There was lithe grace, strength, and resolution in every
line of her fur-wrapped figure. It is possible that her appearance
would have been less effective in a drawing-room,
but in the wagon she was in her place and in harmony with
her surroundings. Lowering sky, gleaming snow, fur-clad
men, and even the big, dingy locomotive, all fitted curiously
into the scene, and she made an imposing central
figure as she contended with the half-tamed team. Hawtrey
was conscious of a tumult of emotion as he watched
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>The struggle with the team lasted for several minutes,
during which the horses plunged and kicked again, until
Sally stood boldly erect a moment while the wagon rocked
to and fro. Her tall, straight figure was commanding and
her face with a tress of loosened hair streaming out beneath
her fur cap was glowing with excitement. Again
and again she swung the stinging whip. Then it seemed
that the team had had enough, for as she dropped lightly
back into the seat the bronchos broke into a gallop, and in
another moment the wagon, jolting noisily as it bounced
across the track, vanished behind the locomotive. Gregory
heard a shout of acclamation as he turned and hurried
after it.
</p>
<p>Sally drove right through the settlement and back outside
it before she could check the horses, and she had just
pulled them up in front of the wooden hotel when Hawtrey
reached it. He stood beside the wagon holding up
his hand to her, and Sally, who laughed, dropped bodily
into his arms, which was, as he realized, a thing that
Agatha certainly would not have done. He set Sally down
upon the sidewalk, and when a man came out to take the
team Hawtrey took her into the hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the locomotive that did it,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;They were most too scared for anything, but I hate to be
beaten by a team. Ours know too much to try, but I got
Haslem to drive me in. I dropped him at Norton&#8217;s, who&#8217;ll
bring him on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He oughtn&#8217;t to have left you with them,&#8221; said Hawtrey
severely.
</p>
<p>Sally laughed. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;I&#8217;d quit driving
if I couldn&#8217;t handle any team you or Haslem could put the
harness on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hotels in the smaller prairie settlements offer one
very little comfort or privacy. As a rule they contain two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
general rooms, in one of which the three daily meals are
served with a punctuality which is as unvarying as the
menu. The traveler who arrives a few minutes too late for
one meal must wait until the next is ready. The second
room usually contains a rusty stove, and a few uncomfortable
benches; and there are not infrequently a couple of
rows of very small match-boarded cubicles on the floor
overhead. The Occident was, however, a notable exception.
For one thing, the building was unusually large,
and its proprietor had condescended to study the requirements
of his guests, who came from the outlying settlements.
There were two rooms above the general lounging
place on the first floor, one of which was reserved for the
wives and daughters of the farmers who drove in long distances
to purchase stores or clothing. In the other, dry-goods
traveling men were permitted to display their wares,
and privileged customers who wished to leave by a train,
the departure of which did not correspond with the hotel
arrangements, were occasionally supplied with meals.
</p>
<p>It was getting dusk when Hawtrey and Sally entered the
first of the two rooms, where the proprietor&#8217;s wife was just
lighting the big lamp. The woman smiled at Gregory,
who was a favorite of hers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go right along, and I&#8217;ll bring your supper up in a
minute or two,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll want it after
your drive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey strode on down a short corridor towards the
second room, but Sally stopped behind him a moment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Hastings in town?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I thought I saw
his new wagon outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His wife is,&#8221; said the other woman. &#8220;She and Miss
Ismay drove in to buy some things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally asked no further questions. It was evident that
Mrs. Hastings would not start home until after supper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
and as the regular hour meal would be ready in about half
an hour it seemed certain that she would come back to the
hotel very shortly. That left Sally very little time, for she
had no desire that Hawtrey should meet either Mrs. Hastings
or Agatha until she had carried out the purpose she
had in hand. It was at Gregory&#8217;s special request that she
had permitted him to drive in to see her off, and she meant
to make the most of the opportunity. She had long ago
regretted her folly in running away from his homestead
when he lay helpless, but things had changed considerably
since then.
</p>
<p>When she entered the second room, she said nothing to
Hawtrey about what she had heard. The room was cozily
warm and brightly lighted, and the little table was laid
for two with a daintiness very uncommon on the prairie.
It was a change for Sally to be waited on and to have a
meal set before her which she had not prepared with her
own fingers, and she sank into a chair with a smile of appreciation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s real nice, Gregory,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;Supper&#8217;s
never quite the same when you&#8217;ve had to stand over the
stove ever so long getting it ready.&#8221; She sighed. &#8220;When
I have to do that after working hard all day I don&#8217;t want
to eat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man felt compassionate. Sally, as he was aware,
had to work unusually hard at the desolate homestead
where she and her mother perforce undertook a great many
duties that do not generally fall to a woman. Creighton,
who was getting to be an old man, was of a grasping nature,
and hired assistance only when it was indispensable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Hawtrey responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m not particularly
fond of cooking either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally glanced at him with a provoking smile, for he had
given her a lead. &#8220;Then,&#8221; she asked with a coquettish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
raising of the eyebrows, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you get somebody else
to do it for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was, as Gregory recognized, almost painfully direct,
but there was no doubt that Sally looked very pretty with
the faint flush of color in her cheeks and the tantalizing
light in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, that&#8217;s a thing I&#8217;ve been thinking
over rather often the last few months,&#8221; he said, and he
laughed. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather a pity you don&#8217;t seem to like cooking,
Sally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally appeared to consider this. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it
depends a lot on who it&#8217;s for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey became suddenly serious for a moment or two.
There was no doubt that at one time he would have considered
it impossible that he should marry a girl of Sally&#8217;s
description, and even now he had misgivings. He had,
however, almost made up his mind, and he was not exactly
pleased that the proprietor&#8217;s wife came in with the meal,
and stayed to talk a while.
</p>
<p>When the woman went out he watched Sally with close
and what he imagined was unobtrusive attention while she
ate, and though he was aware of the indelicacy of his scrutiny,
he was relieved to find that she did nothing that was
actually repugnant to him. There was a certain daintiness
about the girl, and her frank appreciation of the good
things set before her only amused him. She was certainly
much more companionable than Agatha had been since she
came out to Canada, and her cheerful laughter had a pleasant
ring.
</p>
<p>When at last the meal was over Sally bade Gregory draw
her chair up to the stove.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, as she pointed to another chair across
the room, &#8220;you can sit yonder and smoke. I know you
want to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>Hawtrey remembered that Agatha did not like tobacco
smoke, and always had been inclined to exact a certain conventional
deference which he had grown to regard as rather
out of place upon the prairie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My chair&#8217;s a very long way off,&#8221; he objected.
</p>
<p>Sally showed no sign of conceding the point as he had
expected, and he took out his pipe. He wanted to think,
for once more instincts deep down in him stirred in faint
protest against what he almost meant to do. There were
also several points that required practical consideration,
and among them were his financial difficulties, though
these did not trouble him so much as they had done a few
months earlier. For a minute or two neither of them said
anything, and then Sally spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re worrying about something, Gregory,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey admitted it. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I am. My
place is a poor one, and when Wyllard comes home I shall
have to go back to it again. Things would be so much
easier for me just now if I had the Range.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl looked at him steadily with reproach in her
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;your place is quite big enough if you&#8217;d
only take hold and run it as it ought to be run. You could
surely do it, Gregory, if you tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s resistance grew feebler, as it usually did
when his prudence was at variance with his desires. Sally&#8217;s
words were in this case wholly guileless, as he recognized,
and they stirred him. He made no comment, however,
and she spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it worth while, though there are things you would
have to give up?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t go away
and waste your money in Winnipeg every now and then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey laughed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;I suppose if
I meant to make anything of the place that couldn&#8217;t be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
done. Still, you see, it&#8217;s horribly lonely sitting by oneself
beside the stove in the long winter nights. I wouldn&#8217;t
want to go to Winnipeg if I had only somebody to keep
me company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned towards her suddenly with decision in his
face, and Sally lowered her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you could get anybody if you tried?&#8221;
she inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble,&#8221; said Hawtrey gravely, &#8220;is that I have
so little to offer. It&#8217;s a poor place, and I&#8217;m almost afraid,
Sally, that I&#8217;m rather a poor farmer. As you have once
or twice pointed out, I don&#8217;t stay with things. Still, it
might be different if there was any particular reason why
I should.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rose, and crossing the room, stood close beside her
chair. &#8220;Sally,&#8221; he added, &#8220;would you be afraid to take
hold and see what you could make of the place and me?
Perhaps you could make something, though it would probably
be very hard work, my dear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The blood surged into the girl&#8217;s face, and she looked up
at him with open triumph in her eyes. It was her hour,
and Sally, as it happened, was not afraid of anything.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;you really want me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Hawtrey quietly; &#8220;I think I have wanted
you for ever so long, though I did not know it until
lately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can, Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/wheat-242.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 354px; height: 425px;' /><br />

&#8220;&#8216;WOULD YOU BE AFRAID TO SEE WHAT YOU COULD MAKE OF THE PLACE AND ME?&#8217;&#8221; <i>Page</i> 242
<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Hawtrey bent his head and kissed her with a deference
that he had not expected to feel, for there was something
in the girl&#8217;s simplicity and the completeness of her surrender
which, though the thing seemed astonishing, laid a
restraint on him. As he sat down on the arm of her chair
with a hand upon her shoulder, he was more astonished
still, for she quietly made it clear that she expected a good
deal from him. For one thing, he realized that she meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
him to take and to keep a foremost place among his neighbors,
and, though Sally had not the gift of clear and imaginative
expression, it became apparent that this was less
for her own sake than his. She was, with somewhat crude
forcefulness, trying to arouse a sense of responsibility in
the man, to incite him to resolute action and wholesome
restraint, and, as he remembered what he had hitherto
thought of her, a salutary sense of confusion crept upon
him.
</p>
<p>She seemed to recognize it, for at length she glanced up
at him sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Gregory? Why do you look at me like
that?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey smiled in a perplexed fashion. Hitherto she
had made her appeal through his senses to one side of his
nature only. There was no doubt on that point, but now
it seemed there were in her qualities he had never suspected.
She had desired him as a husband, but it was becoming
clear that she would not be content with the mere
possession of him. Sally, it seemed, had wider ideas in
her mind, and, though the idea seemed almost ludicrous,
she wanted to be proud of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;I can&#8217;t quite tell you&mdash;but
you have made me heartily ashamed. I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s a
very rash thing you are going to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked at him with candid anxiety, and then appeared
to dismiss the subject with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much I want to say, and it mayn&#8217;t be so
easy&mdash;afterwards,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity the train starts
so soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can get over that difficulty, anyway,&#8221; said Hawtrey.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll come on as far as I can with you, and get back
from one of the way stations by the Pacific express.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally made no objections, and drawing a little closer to
him she talked on in a low voice.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A PAINFUL REVELATION</h3>
</div>

<p>A sprinkle of snow was driving down the unpaved street
before the biting wind, when Mrs. Hastings came out of a
store in the settlement and handed Sproatly, who was waiting
close by, several big packages.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put them into the wagon, and tell Jake we&#8217;ll
want the team as soon as supper&#8217;s over,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to stay with Mrs. Ormond to-night, and I don&#8217;t want
to get there too late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly took the parcels, and Mrs. Hastings turned to
Agatha, who stood a pace or two behind her with Winifred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she announced, &#8220;if there&#8217;s nothing else you
want to buy we&#8217;ll go across to the hotel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were standing in a big comfortless room in the
hotel when Sproatly rejoined them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This place is quite shivery,&#8221; observed Mrs. Hastings.
&#8220;They generally have the stove lighted in the little room
along the corridor. Go and see, Jim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly went out. It happened that he was wearing
rubber boots, which make very little noise. He proceeded
along the dark corridor, and then stopped abruptly when he
had almost reached a partly-open door, for he could see
into a lighted room. Hawtrey was sitting near the stove
on the arm of Sally&#8217;s chair.
</p>
<p>Though he was not greatly surprised, Sproatly drew
back a pace or two into the shadow, for it became evident
that there were only two courses open to him. He could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
judiciously announce his presence by making the door rattle,
and then go in and mention as casually as possible that
Mrs. Hastings and Agatha were in the hotel. He felt that
he ought to do it, but there was the difficulty that he could
not warn Hawtrey without embarrassing Sally. Sproatly
hesitated in honest doubt as it became evident that the
situation was a delicate one. He decided on the alternative.
He would go back quietly, and keep Mrs. Hastings
out of the room if it could be done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you would be just as comfortable where you
are,&#8221; he informed her when he joined the others.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rather doubtful,&#8221; declared Mrs. Hastings.
&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t the stove lighted?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Sproatly, &#8220;I fancy it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I sent you to make sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, I didn&#8217;t go in,&#8221; said Sproatly uneasily.
&#8220;There&#8217;s somebody in the room already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Any of the boys would go out if they knew we wanted
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; acquiesced Sproatly. &#8220;Still, you see, it&#8217;s
only a small room, and one of them has been smoking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings flashed a keen glance at him, and then
smiled in a manner he did not like. It suggested that
while she yielded to his objections she had by no means
abandoned the subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what shall we do until supper?
This stove won&#8217;t draw properly, and I don&#8217;t feel inclined
to sit shivering here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Sproatly was seized by what proved to be a singularly
unfortunate inspiration.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really not snowing much, and we&#8217;ll go down to
the depôt and watch the Atlantic express come in,&#8221; he
suggested. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the things everybody does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was, as a matter of fact, correct. There are not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
many amusements open to the inhabitants of the smaller
settlements along the railroad track, and the arrival of the
infrequent trains is a source of unflagging interest. Mrs.
Hastings fell in with the suggestion, and Sproatly was
congratulating himself upon his diplomacy, when Agatha
stopped as they reached the door of the hotel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only brought one of my mittens.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back for the other,&#8221; responded Sproatly
promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know where I left it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll lend you one of mine. It will certainly go
on,&#8221; the man persisted.
</p>
<p>Agatha objected to this, and Sproatly, who fancied that
Mrs. Hastings was watching him, let her go, after which
he and the others moved out into the street. Agatha ran
back to the room they had left, and, finding the mitten,
had reached the head of the stairway when she heard voices
behind her in the corridor. She recognized them, and
turned in sudden astonishment. Standing in the shadow
she involuntarily waited. Not far away a stream of light
from the door of the room shone out into the corridor.
Next moment Hawtrey and Sally approached the door, and
as the light fell upon them the blood surged into Agatha&#8217;s
face, for she remembered the embarrassment in Sproatly&#8217;s
manner, and that he had done all he could to prevent her
from going back for the mitten.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey spoke to Sally, and there was no doubt whatever
that he called her &#8220;My dear.&#8221; Filled with burning
indignation, Agatha stood still for a moment and they were
almost upon her before she turned and fled precipitately
down the stairway. She felt that this was horribly undignified,
but she could not stay and face them. When she
overtook the others she had recovered her outward composure,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
and they went on together toward the track. As
yet she was conscious only of anger at Gregory&#8217;s treachery.
That feeling possessed her too completely for her to be conscious
of anything else.
</p>
<p>Cold as it was, there were a good many loungers in the
station, and Sproatly, who spoke to one or two of them,
led his party away from the little shed where they loitered,
and walked briskly up and down beside the track until a
speck of blinking light rose out of the white wilderness.
The light grew rapidly larger, until they could make out a
trail of smoke behind it, and the roar of wheels rose in a
long crescendo. Then a bell commenced to toll, and the
blaze of a big lamp beat into their faces as the great locomotive
came clanking into the station.
</p>
<p>The locomotive stopped, and the light from the long car
windows fell upon the groups of watching fur-clad men,
while here and there a shadowy object that showed black
against it leaned out from a platform. There was, however,
no sign of any passengers for the train until at the
last moment two figures appeared hurrying along. They
drew nearer, and Agatha set her lips tight as she recognized
them, for the light from a vestibule shone into Hawtrey&#8217;s
face as he half lifted Sally on to one of the platforms and
sprang up after her. Then the bell tolled again, and the
train slid slowly out of the station with its lights flashing
upon the snow.
</p>
<p>Agatha turned away abruptly and walked a little apart
from the rest. The thing, she felt, admitted of only one
explanation. Sproatly&#8217;s diplomacy had had a most unfortunate
result, and she was sensible of an intolerable disgust.
She had kept faith with Gregory, at least as far as
it was possible, and he had utterly humiliated her. The
affront he had put upon her was almost unbearable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Mrs. Hastings walked up to Sproatly,
who, feeling distinctly uncomfortable, had drawn back
judiciously into the shadow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I understand. You, of course, anticipated
this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Sproatly with a decision which carried
conviction with it. &#8220;I certainly saw them at the
hotel, but how could I imagine that they had anything of
the kind in view?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off for a moment, and waved his hand. &#8220;After
all,&#8221; he added, &#8220;what right have you to think it now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings laughed somewhat harshly. &#8220;Unfortunately,
I have my eyes, but I&#8217;ll admit that there&#8217;s a certain
obligation on me to make quite certain before going any
further. That&#8217;s why I want you to ascertain where he
checked his baggage to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s more than I&#8217;m willing to undertake.
Do you consider it advisable to set the station agent wondering
about the thing? Besides, once or twice in my
career appearances have been rather badly against me, and
I&#8217;m not altogether convinced yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings let the matter drop, and they went back
rather silently to the hotel. As soon as supper was past,
Mrs. Hastings bade Sproatly get their wagon out and she
drove away with Agatha. During the long, cold journey
she said very little to the girl, and they had no opportunity
of private conversation when they reached the homestead
where they were to spend the night. Agatha hated herself
for the thought in her mind, but everything seemed to
warrant it, and it would not be driven out. She had heard
what Gregory had called Sally at the hotel, and the fact
that he must have bought his ticket and checked his baggage
earlier in the afternoon when there was nobody about,
so that he could run down with Sally at the last moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
evidently in order to escape observation, was very significant.
</p>
<p>The two women went home next day, and on the following
morning a man, who was driving in to Lander&#8217;s,
brought Mrs. Hastings a note from Sproatly. It was very
brief, and ran:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory arrived same night by Pacific train. It is
evident he must have got off at the next station down the
line.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings showed it to her husband.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we have been too hasty. What am I to do
with this?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Hastings smiled. &#8220;Since you ask my advice, I&#8217;d put
it into the stove.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it clears the man. Isn&#8217;t it my duty to show it
to Agatha?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hastings reflectively, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that
it is your duty to put ideas into her mind when you can&#8217;t
be quite certain that she has entertained them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be greatly astonished if she hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered
Mrs. Hastings.
</p>
<p>Hastings made an expressive gesture. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll no doubt do what you think wisest. When
you come to me for advice you have usually made up your
mind, and you merely expect me to tell you that you&#8217;re
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings thought over the matter for another hour
or two. For one thing, Agatha&#8217;s quiet manner puzzled
her, and she did not know that the girl had passed a night
in agony of anger and humiliation, and had then become
conscious of a relief of which she was ashamed. There
was, however, no doubt that while Agatha blamed herself
in some degree for what had happened, she did feel as if a
weight had been lifted from her heart. She was sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
alone in a shadowy room watching the light die off the
snowy prairie outside, when Mrs. Hastings came softly in
and sat down beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings, &#8220;it&#8217;s rather difficult to
speak of, but that little scene at the station must have hurt
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked at her quietly and searchingly, but there
was only sympathy in her face, and she leaned forward impulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;it hurt me horribly, because I
feel it was my fault. I was the cause of it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How could that be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had only been kinder to Gregory he would, perhaps,
never have thought of that girl. I must have made
it clear that he jarred upon me. I drove him&#8221;&mdash;Agatha
turned her face away, while her voice trembled&mdash;&#8220;into
that woman&#8217;s arms. No doubt she was ready to make the
most of the opportunity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings thought that the girl&#8217;s scorn and disgust
were perfectly natural, even though, as it happened, they
were not quite warranted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place,&#8221; she suggested, &#8220;I think you had
better read this note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha took the note, and there was light enough left
to show that the blood had crept into her face when she laid
it down again. For almost a minute she sat very still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great relief to know that I was wrong&mdash;in one
respect, but you must not think I hated this girl because
Gregory had preferred her to me,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;When
the first shock had passed, there was an almost horrible
satisfaction in feeling that he had released me&mdash;at any
cost. I suppose I shall always be ashamed of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She broke off a moment, and her voice was very steady
when she went on again:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Still, what Sproatly says does not alter the case so
much after all. It can&#8217;t free me of my responsibility. If
I hadn&#8217;t driven him, Gregory would not have gone to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You consider that in itself a very dreadful thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked at Mrs. Hastings with suddenly lifted
head. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Can you doubt it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings laughed, though there was a little gleam
in her eyes, for this was an opportunity for which she had
been waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you spoke like an Englishwoman&mdash;of
station&mdash;just out from the Old Country&mdash;but I&#8217;m going
to try to disabuse you of one impression. Sally, to put it
crudely, is quite good enough for Gregory. In fact, if
she had been my daughter I&#8217;d have kept him away from
her. To begin with, once you strip Gregory of his little
surface graces, and his clean English intonation, how does
he compare with the men you meet out here? What does
his superiority consist of? Is he truer or kinder than you
have found most of them to be? Has he a finer courage,
or a more resolute endurance&mdash;a greater capacity for labor,
or a clearer knowledge of the calling by which he makes
his living?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha did not answer. She could not protest that
Gregory possessed any of these qualities, and Mrs. Hastings
continued:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he even a more handsome person? I could point
to a dozen men between here and the railroad, whose clean,
self-denying lives have set a stamp on them that Gregory
will never wear. To descend to perhaps the lowest point
of all, has he more money? We know he wasted what he
had&mdash;probably in indulgence&mdash;and there is a mortgage on
his farm. Has he any sense of honor? He let Sally believe
he was in love with her before you even came out
here, and of late, while he still claimed you, he has gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
back to her. Can&#8217;t you get away from your point of view,
and realize what kind of a man he is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha turned her head away. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I
realized him&mdash;several months ago. They were painful
months to me. But you are quite sure he was in love with
Sally before I came out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Mrs. Hastings declared, &#8220;his conduct suggested
it.&#8221; She laid a caressing hand on the girl&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;You tried to keep faith with him. Tried desperately,
I think. Did you succeed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha contrived to meet the older woman&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, I would have married him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; asserted Mrs. Hastings, &#8220;I can forgive Gregory
even his treachery, and you have no cause to pity him.
Sally is simple&mdash;primitive, you would call her&mdash;but she&#8217;s
clever and capable in all practical things. She will bear
with Gregory when you would turn from him in dismay,
and, when it is necessary, she will not shrink from putting
a little judicious pressure on him in a way you could not
have done. It may sound incomprehensible, but that girl
will lead or drive Gregory very much further than he could
have gone with you. She doesn&#8217;t regard him as perfection,
but she loves him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings paused, and for several minutes there was
a tense silence in the little shadowy room. It had grown
almost dark, and the square of the window glimmered
faintly with the dim light flung up by the snow.
</p>
<p>Agatha turned slowly in her chair. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she
said in a low voice. &#8220;You have taken a heavy weight off
my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She paused a moment, and then added, &#8220;You have been
a good friend all along. It was supreme good fortune that
placed me in your hands.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings patted her shoulder, and then went out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
quietly. Agatha lay still in her chair beside the stove.
The fire snapped and crackled cheerfully, but except for
the pleasant sound, there was a restful quietness. The
room was cozily warm, though its occupant could hear a
little icy wind wail about the building. It swept Agatha&#8217;s
thoughts away to the frozen North, and she realized what
it had cost her to keep faith with Gregory as she pictured
a little snow-sheeted schooner hemmed in among the floes,
and two or three worn-out men hauling a sled painfully
over the ridged and furrowed ice. The man who had gone
up into that great desolation had been endued with an almost
fantastic sense of honor, and now he might never
even know that she loved him. She admitted that she had
loved him for several months.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THROUGH THE SNOW</h3>
</div>

<p>Next morning, the mail-carrier, who, half-frozen and white
all over, drove up to the homestead out of a haze of falling
snow, brought Agatha a note from Gregory. The note was
brief, and Agatha read it with a smile of half-amused contempt,
though she admitted that, considering everything,
he had handled the embarrassing situation gracefully.
This attitude, however, was only what she had expected,
and she recognized that it was characteristic of Hawtrey
that he had written releasing her from her engagement instead
of seeking an interview. Gregory, as she realized
now, had always taken the easiest way, and it was evident
that he had not even the courage to face her. She quietly
dropped the note&mdash;it did not seem worth while to fling it&mdash;into
the stove.
</p>
<p>Agatha could forgive Gregory for choosing Sally.
Though she was very human in most respects, that scarcely
troubled her, but she could not forgive him for persisting
in his claim to her while he was philandering&mdash;and this
seemed the most fitting term&mdash;with her rival. Had he
only been honest, she would not have let Wyllard go away
without some assurance of her regard which would have
cheered the brave seafarer on his perilous journey. And
it was clear to her that Wyllard might never come back
again! Her face grew hard when she thought of it, and
she had thought of it frequently. For that double-dealing
she felt she almost hated Gregory.
</p>
<p>A month passed drearily, with Arctic frost outside on
the prairie, and little to do inside the homestead except to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
cook and gorge the stove, and endeavor to keep warmth in
one&#8217;s body. Water froze solid inside the house, stinging
draughts crept in through the double windows, and there
were evenings when Mrs. Hastings and Agatha, shivering
close beside the stove, waited anxiously for the first sign
of Hastings and the hired man, who were bringing back a
sled loaded with birch logs from a neighboring bluff. The
bluff was only a few miles away, but men sent out to cut
fuel in the awful cold snaps in that country have now and
then sunk down in the snow with the life frozen out of
them. There were other days when the wooden building
seemed to rock beneath the buffeting of the icy hurricane,
and it was a perilous matter to cross the narrow open space
between it and the stables through the haze of swirling
snow.
</p>
<p>The weather moderated a little by and by, and one
afternoon Mrs. Hastings drove off to Lander&#8217;s with the one
hired man that they kept through the winter. Mr. Hastings
had set out earlier for the bluff, and as the Scandinavian
maid had been married and had gone away, Agatha
was left in the house with the little girls.
</p>
<p>It was bitterly cold, even inside the dwelling, but Agatha
was busy baking, and she failed to notice that the temperature
had become almost Arctic, until she stood beside a
window as evening was closing in. A low, dingy sky hung
over the narrowing sweep of prairie which stretched back,
gleaming lividly, into the creeping dusk, but a few minutes
later a haze of snow whirled across it and cut off the
dreary scene.
</p>
<p>The light died out suddenly, and Agatha and the little
girls drew their chairs close up to the stove. The house
was very quiet, and Agatha could hear the mournful wailing
of the wind about it, with now and then the soft swish
of driven snow upon the walls and roofing shingles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>The table was laid for supper, and the kettle was singing
cheerfully upon the stove, but there was no sign of
the other members of the family, and presently Agatha began
to feel a little anxious. Mrs. Hastings, she fancied,
would stay one night at Lander&#8217;s, if there was any unfavorable
change in the weather, but she wondered what
could be detaining Hastings. It was not very far to the
bluff, and as he could not have continued chopping in the
darkness it seemed to her that he should have reached the
homestead.
</p>
<p>He did not come, however, and she grew more uneasy as
the time slipped by. The wail of the wind grew louder
and the stove crackled more noisily. At last one of the
little girls rose with a cry that she thought she heard the
beat of hoofs. The impression grew more distinct until
she was sure that some one was riding toward the homestead,
and Agatha heard the hoofbeats, but soon after that
the sound ceased abruptly, and she could not hear the rattle
of flung-down logs which she had expected. This struck
Agatha as curious, since she knew that Hastings generally
unloaded the sled before he led the team to the stable.
She waited a moment or two, but except for the doleful
wind nothing broke the silence now, and when the stillness
became oppressive she moved towards the door.
</p>
<p>The wind tore the door from her grasp when she opened
it, and flung it against the wall with a jarring crash, while
a fine powder that stung the skin unbearably drove into
her face. For a few moments she could see nothing but a
whirling haze, and then, as her eyes became accustomed
to the change of light, she dimly made out the blurred
white figures of the horses standing still, with the load of
birch logs rising a shapeless mass behind them. There
seemed to be nobody with the team, and, though she twice
called sharply, no answer came out of the falling snow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Then she recognized the significant fact that the team had
come home alone.
</p>
<p>It was difficult to close the door, and before she accomplished
what was a feat of strength her hands had stiffened
and grown almost useless, and the hall was strewn with
snow. It was every evident that there was something for
her to do. It cost her three or four minutes to slip on a
blanket skirt, and soft hide moccasins, with gum boots over
them. Muffled in her furs, she opened the door again.
When she had contrived to close it, the cold struck through
her to the bone as she floundered towards the team. There
was nobody to whom she could look for assistance, but that
could not be helped. It was evident that some misfortune
had befallen Hastings and that she must act wisely and
quickly.
</p>
<p>The first thing necessary was to unload the sled, and,
though the birches seldom grow to any size in a prairie
bluff, some of the logs were heavy. She was gasping with
the effort when she had flung a few of them down, after
which she discovered that the rest were held up by one
or two stout poles let into sockets. Try as she would, she
could not get them out, and then she remembered that
Hastings kept a whipsaw in a shed close by. She contrived
to find it, and attacked the poles in breathless haste,
working clumsily with mittened hands, until there was a
crash and rattle as she sprang clear. Then she started the
team, and the rest of the logs rolled off into the snow.
</p>
<p>That was one difficulty overcome, but the next appeared
more serious. She must find the bluff as soon as possible,
and in the snow-filled darkness she could not tell where it
lay. Even if she could have seen anything of the kind,
there was no landmark on the desolate level waste between
it and the homestead. She, however, remembered that she
had one guide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>Hastings and his hired man had recently hauled in a
great many loads of birch logs, and as they had made a
well-worn trail it seemed to her just possible that she
might trace it back to the bluff. No great weight of snow
had fallen yet.
</p>
<p>Before Agatha set out she had a struggle with the team,
for the horses evidently had no intention of making another
journey if they could help it, but at last she swung
them into the narrow riband of trail, and plodded away
into the darkness at their heads. It was then that she first
clearly realized what she had undertaken. Very little of
her face was left bare between her fur cap and collar, but
every inch of uncovered skin tingled as if it had been
lashed with thorns or stabbed with innumerable needles.
The air was thick with a fine powder that filled her eyes
and nostrils, the wind buffeted her, and there was an awful
cold&mdash;the cold that taxes the utmost strength of mind and
body of those who are forced to face it on the shelterless
prairie.
</p>
<p>Still the girl struggled on, feeling with half-frozen feet
for the depression of the trail, and grappling with a horrible
dismay when she failed to find it. She was never sure
to what extent she guided the team, or how far from mere
force of habit they headed for the bluff, but as the time
went by, and there was nothing before her but the whirling
snow, she grew feverishly apprehensive. The trail was
becoming fainter and fainter, and now and then she could
find no trace of it for several minutes.
</p>
<p>The horses floundered on, blurred shapes as white as the
haze they crept through, and at length she felt that they
were dipping into a hollow. Then a faint sense of comfort
crept into her heart as she remembered that a shallow
ravine which seamed the prairie ran through the bluff.
She called out, and started at the faintness of her voice.
It seemed such a pitifully feeble thing. There was no answer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
nothing but the soft fall of the horses&#8217; hoofs and the
wail of the wind, but the wind was reassuring, for the volume
of sound suggested that it was driving through a bluff
close by.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later Agatha cried out again, and this
time she felt the throbbing of her heart, for a faint sound
came out of the whirling haze. She pulled the horses up,
and as she stood still listening, a blurred object appeared
almost in front of them. It shambled forward in a curious
manner, stopped, and moved again, and in another moment
or two Hastings lurched by her with a stagger and
sank down into a huddled white heap on the sled. She
turned back towards him, and he seemed to look up at
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn the team,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Agatha obeyed, and sat down beside him when the horses
moved on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A small birch I was chopping fell on me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it smashed my ankle, or whether
I twisted it wriggling clear&mdash;the thing pinned me down.
It is badly hurt anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke disconnectedly and hoarsely, as if in pain, and
Agatha, who noticed that one of his gum boots was almost
ripped to pieces, realized part of what he must have suffered.
She knew that nobody pinned to the ground and
helpless could have withstood that cold for more than a
very little while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;it must have been dreadful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found a branch,&#8221; Hastings added. &#8220;It helped me,
but I fell over every now and then. Headed for the homestead.
Don&#8217;t think I could have made it if you hadn&#8217;t
come for me!&#8221; He stopped abruptly, and turned to her.
&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t sit down. Walk&mdash;keep warm&mdash;but don&#8217;t
try to lead the team.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha struggled forward as far as the near horse&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
shoulder. The team slightly sheltered her, and it was a
little easier walking with a hand upon a trace. It was a
relief to cling to something, for the wind that flung the
snow into her face drove her garments against her limbs,
so that now and then she could scarcely move. When her
strength began to flag, every yard of the homeward journey
was made with infinite pain and difficulty. At times
she could scarcely see the horses, and again, blinded,
breathless and dazed, she stumbled along beside them.
She did not know how Hastings was faring, but she half-consciously
recognized that if once she let the trace go the
sled would slip away from her and she would sink down to
freeze.
</p>
<p>At last, however, a dim mass crept out of the white haze
ahead, and a moment later a man laid hold of her. The
man told her that Mrs. Hastings was with him, and that
the homestead was close at hand. Agatha learned afterwards
that they had reached the house a short time previously
and had immediately set out in search of her and
Hastings.
</p>
<p>She floundered on beside the horses, with another
team dimly visible in front of her, until a faint ray
of light streamed out into the snow. Then the team
stopped, and she had only a hazy recollection of staggering
into a lighted room in the homestead and sinking into
a chair. What they did with Hastings she did not know,
but Mrs. Hastings, who went with her to her room, kissed
her before she left her.
</p>
<p>Nobody could have faced the snow next morning, and it
was several days later when Watson, who had attended
Hawtrey after his accident, was brought over. Watson
did what he could, but it was several weeks before Hastings
could use his injured foot again. Before Hastings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
recovered, news was sent him of some difficulty in the affairs
of a small creamery at a settlement further along the
line, in which he and his wife held an interest, and Mrs.
Hastings went East to make inquiries respecting it. She
took Agatha with her, and one evening after she had finished
the business she had in hand they left a little way
station by the Pacific train.
</p>
<p>The car that they entered was empty except for two persons
who sat close together near the middle of it. A big
lamp overhead shed a brilliant light, and Agatha started
when one of their fellow passengers looked around as she
approached him. In another moment she stood face to face
with Hawtrey, who had risen, while Sally gazed up at her
with a curious expression in her eyes. Agatha was perfectly
composed. She felt no sympathy for Hawtrey, who
was visibly confused. She was not surprised that he found
the situation a somewhat difficult one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been to Winnipeg?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Hawtrey, with evident relief that she
had chosen a safe topic, &#8220;only to Brandon. Sally has
some friends there, and she spends a day or two with them
once or twice each winter. Brandon is quite a lively place
after the prairie. I went in last night to bring her back.&#8221;
He turned to his companion, &#8220;I think you have met Miss
Ismay?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was conscious that Sally&#8217;s eyes were fixed upon
her, and that Mrs. Hastings was watching them all with
quiet amusement, but she was a little astonished when the
girl moved some wraps from the seat opposite her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I have. If Miss Ismay doesn&#8217;t mind,
I should like to talk to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey&#8217;s relief was evident, and Agatha glanced at him
with a smile that was half-contemptuous. He had carefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
kept out of her way since he had written her the note,
and now it seemed only natural that if there was anything
to be said, he should leave it to Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go along for a smoke,&#8221; he observed with
evident impatience to leave them, and he retired precipitately.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings looked after him, and laughed in a manner
that caused Sally to wince.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem anxious to talk to me,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You can come along to the next car by and by, Agatha.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She moved away, and Agatha, who sat down opposite
Sally, looked at her questioningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Sally made a little deprecatory gesture. &#8220;I&#8217;ve something
to say, but it&#8217;s hard. To begin with, are you very
angry with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Agatha. &#8220;I think I really am a little
angry with Gregory, but not altogether because he chose
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally considered this statement for a moment or two before
she looked up again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she confessed, &#8220;not long ago, I wanted to hate
you, and I guess I &#8217;most succeeded. It made things easier.
Still, I want to say that I don&#8217;t hate you now.&#8221; She hesitated
a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;d like you to forgive me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled. &#8220;I can do that willingly,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Sally was disconcerted by her quiet ease of manner and
perfect candor. It was evidently not quite what she had
looked for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you were never very fond of him?&#8221; she suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Agatha reflectively, &#8220;since you have
compelled me to say it, I don&#8217;t think now that I ever was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
really fond of him, though I don&#8217;t know how I can make
that quite clear to you. It was only after I came out here
that I&mdash;realized&mdash;Gregory. It was not the actual man I
fell in love with in England.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally turned her face away, for Agatha had made her
meaning perfectly plain. Somewhat to Sally&#8217;s astonishment,
she showed no sign of resentment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Sally responded, &#8220;it is way better that you
didn&#8217;t marry him.&#8221; She paused, and seemed to search
for words with which to express herself. &#8220;I knew all along
all there was to know about Gregory&mdash;except that he was
going to marry you, and it was some time before I heard
that&mdash;and I was ready to take him. I was fond of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s heart went out to her. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said simply,
&#8220;it is a very good thing that I let him go.&#8221; She
smiled. &#8220;That, however, doesn&#8217;t quite describe it, Sally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregory&#8217;s fiancée flushed. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have said that,
but you don&#8217;t quite understand yet. I said I knew all
there was to know about him&mdash;and you never did. You
made too much of him in England, and when you came
out here you only saw the things you didn&#8217;t like in him.
Still, they weren&#8217;t the only ones.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha started at this statement, for she realized that
part of it was certainly true, and she could admit the possibility
of all of it being a fact. Gregory might possess
a few good qualities that she had never discovered!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did,&#8221; she admitted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it matters
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all of them mixed,&#8221; persisted Sally. &#8220;One
can&#8217;t expect too much, but you can bear with a great deal
when you&#8217;re fond of any one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat silent a while, for she was troubled by a certain
sense of wholesome confusion. It seemed to her that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
Sally had the clearer vision. Love had given her discernment
as well as charity, and, not expecting perfection, it
was the man&#8217;s strong points upon which she fixed her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied presently. &#8220;I am glad you look at
it that way, Sally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl laughed. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only seen one
man on the prairie who was quite white all through, and
I had a kind of notion that he was fond of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha sat very still, but it cost her an effort.
</p>
<p>Her face asked the question that was in her heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry Wyllard,&#8221; announced Sally.
</p>
<p>Agatha made no answer, and Sally changed the subject.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Sally, &#8220;after all, I want you to be friends
with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you can count on that,&#8221; replied Agatha with a
smile, as she rose to rejoin Mrs. Hastings.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE LANDING</h3>
</div>

<p>The ice among the inlets on the American side of the
North Pacific broke up unusually early when spring came
round again, and several weeks before Wyllard had expected
it the <i>Selache</i> floated clear. The crew had suffered
little during the bitter winter, for Dampier had kept
the men busy splicing gear and patching sails, and they
had fitted the schooner with a new mainmast hewn out of
a small cedar. None of the sailors had been trained as
carpenters, but men who keep the sea for months in small
vessels are necessarily handy at repairs, and they had all
used ax and saw to some purpose in their time.
</p>
<p>Wyllard was satisfied when they thrashed the <i>Selache</i>
out of the inlet under whole mainsail in a fresh breeze, and
when evening came he sat smoking near the wheel. He
was in a contemplative mood as the climbing forests and
snow-clad heights dropped back astern. He wondered
what his friends were doing upon the prairie, and whether
Agatha had married Gregory yet. It seemed to him that
it was, at least, possible that Agatha was married, for she
was one to keep a promise, and it was difficult to believe
that Gregory would fail to press his claim. Wyllard&#8217;s face
grew grim as he thought of it, though this was a thing
he had done more or less constantly during the winter.
He fancied that he might have ousted Gregory if he had
remained at the Range, for perhaps unconsciously Agatha
had shown him that she was not quite indifferent to him;
but that would have been to involve her in a breach of
faith which she would probably always have looked back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
on with regret. In any case he could not have stayed to
press his suit. He knew that he would never forget her,
but it was not impossible that she might forget him. He
realized also, though this was not by comparison a matter
of great consequence, that the Range was scarcely likely
to prosper under Gregory&#8217;s management, but that could
not be helped, and after all he owed Gregory something.
It never occurred to him that he was doing an extravagant
thing in setting out upon the search that he had undertaken.
He felt that the obligation was laid upon him,
and, being what he was, he could not shrink from it.
</p>
<p>A puff of spray that blew into his face disturbed his
meditations, and when a little tumbling sea splashed in
over the weather bow, he helped the others to haul down
a reef in the mainsail. That accomplished, he went below
and brought out a well-worn chart. The <i>Selache</i> drove
away to the westwards over a white-flecked sea. This time
she carried fresh southerly breezes with her most of the
way across the Pacific, and plunged along hove down
under the last piece of canvas they dared to set upon her
until at last they ran into the fog close in to the Kamtchatkan
beaches. Then the wind dropped, and they were
baffled by light and fitful breezes, while it became evident
that there was ice about.
</p>
<p>The day they saw the first big mass of ice gleaming
broad across their course on a raw green sea, Dampier
got an observation, and they held a brief council in the
little cabin that evening. The schooner was hove to then,
and lay rolling with banging blocks and thrashing canvas
on a sluggish heave of sea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty miles off shore,&#8221; announced Dampier. &#8220;If it
had been clear enough we&#8217;d have seen the top of the big
range quite a way further out to sea. Now, it&#8217;s drift ice
ahead of us, but it&#8217;s quite likely there&#8217;s a solid block along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
the beach. Winter holds on a long while in this country.
I guess you&#8217;re for pushing on as fast as you can?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard nodded. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll look
for an opening, and work her in as far as possible. Then,
if it&#8217;s necessary, Charly and I and another man will take
the sled and head for the beach across the ice. If there&#8217;s
a lane anywhere I would, however, probably take the smallest
boat. We might haul her a league or two, anyway, on
the sled if the ice wasn&#8217;t very rough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at Charly, who acquiesced.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Charly observed simply, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to
see you through. Now we&#8217;ve made a sled for her I&#8217;d take
the boat, anyway. We&#8217;re quite likely to strike a big
streak of water when the ice is breaking up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one other course,&#8221; declared Dampier; &#8220;the
sensible one, and that&#8217;s to wait until it has gone altogether.
Seems to me I ought to mention it, though it&#8217;s not likely
to appeal to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard laughed. &#8220;From all appearances we might
wait a month. I don&#8217;t want to stay up here any longer
than is strictly necessary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll head north?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my intention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Dampier, pointing to the chart before
them, &#8220;as you should make the beach in the next day or
two I&#8217;ll head for the inlet here. As it&#8217;s not very far you
won&#8217;t have to pack so many provisions along, and I&#8217;ll
give you, say, three weeks to turn up in. If you don&#8217;t,
I&#8217;ll figure that there&#8217;s something wrong, and do what
seems advisable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They agreed to that, and when next morning a little
breeze came out of the creeping haze, they sailed the
<i>Selache</i> slowly shorewards among the drifting ice until, at
nightfall, an apparently impenetrable barrier stretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
gleaming faintly ahead of them. Wyllard turned in soon
afterwards and slept soundly. All his preparations had
been made during the winter and there was no occasion
for new plans. When morning broke he breakfasted before
he went out on deck. The boat was already packed with
provisions, sleeping-bags, a tent, and two light sled frames,
on one of which it seemed possible that they might haul
her a few miles. She was very light and small, and had
been built for such a purpose as they had in view.
</p>
<p>The schooner lay to with backed fore-staysail tumbling
wildly on a dim, gray sea. Half a mile away the ice
ran back into a dingy haze, and there was a low, gray sky
to weather. Now and then a fine sprinkle of snow slid
across the water before a nipping breeze. As Wyllard
glanced to windward Dampier strode up to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;d better put it off,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
like the weather; we&#8217;ll have wind before long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled, and Dampier made a forceful gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he advised, &#8220;I&#8217;d get on to the ice just as
soon as possible. You&#8217;re still quite a way off the
beach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard shook hands with him. &#8220;We should make
the inlet in about nine days, and if I don&#8217;t turn up in
three weeks you&#8217;ll know there&#8217;s something wrong,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s no sign of me in another week you can
take her home again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier, who made no further comment, bade them
swing the boat over, and when she lay heaving beneath
the rail Wyllard and Charly and one Indian dropped into
her. It was only a preliminary search they were about to
engage in, for they had decided that if they found nothing
they would afterwards push further north or inland when
they had supplied themselves with fresh stores from the
schooner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>They gazed at the <i>Selache</i> with grim faces as they
pulled away, and Wyllard, who loosed his oar a moment
to wave his fur cap when Dampier stood upon her rail,
was glad when a fresher rush of the bitter breeze forced
him to fix his attention on his task. The boat was heavily
loaded, and the tops of the gray seas splashed unpleasantly
close about her gunwale. She was running before
them, rising sharply, and dropping down into the hollows,
out of sight of all but the schooner&#8217;s canvas, and
though this made rowing easier, Wyllard was apprehensive
of difficulties when he reached the ice.
</p>
<p>His misgivings proved warranted, for the ice presented
an almost unbroken wall against the face of which the
sea spouted. There was no doubt as to what would happen
if the frail craft was hurled upon that frozen mass,
and Wyllard, who was sculling, fancied that before the
boat could even reach it, there was a probability of
her being swamped in the upheaval where the backwash
met the oncoming sea. Charly looked at him dubiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sure thing we can&#8217;t get out there,&#8221; Charly observed.
</p>
<p>Wyllard nodded. &#8220;Then,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll pull along
the edge of it until we find an opening or something to
make a lee. The sea&#8217;s higher than it seemed to be from
the schooner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do it soon,&#8221; Charly declared. &#8220;There&#8217;s
more wind not far away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard dipped his oar again, and for an hour they
pulled along the edge of the ice, for there were now little
frothing white tops on the seas.
</p>
<p>It was evident that the wind was freshening, and at
times a deluge of icy water slopped in over the gunwale.
The men were hampered by their furs, and the stores
lying about their feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>The perspiration dripped from Wyllard when they approached
a ragged, jutting point. It did not seem advisable
to attempt a landing on that side of it, and when
a little snow began to fall he looked at his companions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve got to pull her out,&#8221; said Charly.
&#8220;Dampier&#8217;s heaving a reef down; he sees what&#8217;s working
up to windward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard could barely make out the schooner, which had
apparently followed them, a blur of dusky canvas against
a bank of haze, and then as the boat slid down into a hollow
there was nothing but the low-hung, lowering sky.
It was evident to him that if they were to make a landing
it must be done promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll pull around the point first, anyway,&#8221; he decided.
</p>
<p>A shower of fine snow that blotted out the schooner
broke upon them, and the work was arduous. They were
pulling to windward now, and it was necessary to watch
the seas that ranged up ahead and to handle the boat circumspectly
while the freshening breeze blew the spray over
them. They had to fight for every fathom, and once or
twice the little craft nearly rolled over with them. It
became apparent by degrees that, as they could not have
reached the schooner had they attempted it, they were
pulling for their lives, and that the one way of escape
open to them was to find an egress of some kind around
the point, the ragged tongue of which was horribly
close to lee of them. When the snow cleared for a
minute or two, they saw that Dampier had driven the
<i>Selache</i> further off the ice. The schooner was hove to
now, and there was a black figure high up in her shrouds.
</p>
<p>A bitter rush of wind hurled the spray about them,
and the boat fell off almost beam-on to the sea, in spite
of all that they could do. The icy brine washed into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
the boat, and it seemed almost certain that she would
swamp or roll over before they could get way on her.
Still, pulling desperately, they drove her around the point.
Gasping and dripping they made their last effort. A sea
rolled up ahead, and as the boat swung up with it Wyllard
had a momentary glimpse of an opening not far away.
He shouted to his companions, but could not tell whether
they heard and understood him, for after that he was conscious
only of rowing savagely until another sea broke into
the boat and she struck. There was a crash, and she
swung clear with the backwash, with all one side smashed
in. Then she swung in again just beyond a tongue of
ice over which the froth was pouring tumultuously, and
the Indian jumped from the bow. He had the painter
with him, and for half a minute, standing in the foam,
he held the boat somehow, while they hurled a few of the
carefully made-up packages that composed her important
freight as far on to the ice as possible.
</p>
<p>As Wyllard, who seized one sled frame, jumped, the
disabled boat rolled over. He landed on his hands and
knees, but in another moment he was on his feet, and he
and the Indian clutched at Charly, who drove towards
them amid a long wash of foam. They dragged him
clear, and as he stood up dripping without his cap a sudden
haze of snow whirled about them. There was no sign
of the schooner, and they could scarcely see the broken ice
some sixty yards away. They had made the landing, wet
through, with about half their stores, and it was evident
that their boat would not carry them across the narrowest
lane of water, even if they could have recovered her. The
sea rumbled along the edge of the ice, and they could
not tell whether the frozen wall extended as far as the
beach. They looked at one another until Wyllard spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got the hand-sled, and some, at least, of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The sooner we start for the beach the
sooner we&#8217;ll get there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a relief to load the sled, and when that was
done they put themselves into the hide traces and set off
across the ice. Their traveling was arduous work apart
from the hauling of the load, for the ice was rough and
broken, and covered for the most part with softening snow.
They had only gum-boots with soft hide moccasins under
them, for snow-shoes are used only in Eastern Canada,
and it takes one a long while to learn to walk on them.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the three men sank almost knee-deep, sometimes
they slipped and scrambled on uncovered ledges, but
they pushed on with the sled bouncing and sliding unevenly
behind them, until the afternoon had almost gone.
</p>
<p>They set up the wet tent behind a hummock, and
crouched inside it upon a ground-sheet, while Charly
boiled a kettle on the little oil blast stove. The wind
hurled the snow upon the straining canvas, which stood
the buffeting. When they had eaten a simple meal Charly
put the stove out and the darkness was not broken except
when one of them struck a match to light his pipe. They
had but one strip of rubber sheeting between them and the
snow, for the water had gotten into the sleeping bags.
Their clothes dried upon them with the heat of their
bodies. They said nothing for a while, and Wyllard was
half asleep when Charly spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about that boat,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Though I don&#8217;t know that we could have done it, we
ought to have tried to pull her out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Wyllard. &#8220;She&#8217;d have been all to
pieces, anyway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m figuring it out like this. If Dampier wasn&#8217;t up
in the shrouds when we made the landing he&#8217;d sent
somebody. We could see him up against the sky, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
we&#8217;d be much less clear to him low down with the ice
and the surf about us. Besides, it was snowing quite
fast then. Well, I don&#8217;t know what Dampier saw, but
I guess he&#8217;d have made out that we hadn&#8217;t hauled the
boat up, anyway. The trouble is that with the wind
freshening and it getting thick he&#8217;d have to thrash the
schooner out and lie to until it cleared. When he runs
in again it&#8217;s quite likely that he&#8217;ll find the boat and an
oar or two. Seems to me that&#8217;s going to worry him considerable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard, drowsy as he was, agreed with this view of the
matter. He realized that it would have been quite impossible
for Dampier to send them any assistance, and it
was merely a question whether they should retrace their
steps to the edge of the ice next morning and make him
some signal. Against this there was the strong probability
that he would not run in, if the gale and snow continued,
and the fact that it was desirable to make the
beach as soon as possible in case the ice broke up before
they reached it. What was rather more to the purpose,
Wyllard was quietly determined on pushing on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;We&#8217;ll start
for the beach as soon as it&#8217;s daylight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly made no answer, and the brawny, dark-skinned
Siwash, who spoke English reasonably well, merely
grunted. Unless it seemed necessary, he seldom said anything
at all. Bred to the sea, and living on the seal and
salmon, an additional hazard or two or an extra strain on
his tough body did not count for much with him. He had
been accustomed to sleep wet through with icy water,
and to crouch for hours with numbed hands clenched on
the steering-paddle while the long sea canoe scudded furiously
over the big combers before bitter gale or driving
snow. Wyllard, who rolled over, pulled a wet sleeping-bag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
across him, and after that there was silence in the little
rocking tent.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Charly&#8217;s deductions had been proved correct, for when
the breeze freshened Dampier climbed into the shrouds.
He had noticed the ominous blackness to windward, and
he knew what it meant. That was why he had hauled down
a reef in the schooner&#8217;s mainsail, and now kept the vessel
out a little from the ice. As the light faded he found it
very difficult to see the boat against the white wash of the
seas that recoiled from the ice, but when the snow was
whirling about him he decided that she was in some peril
unless her crew could pull her around the point. It was
evident that this would be a difficult matter, though he
had only an occasional glimpse of her now. He waved an
arm to the helmsman, who understood that he was to run
the schooner in. There was a rattle of blocks as the booms
swung out, and as the <i>Selache</i> sped away before the rapidly
freshening breeze it seemed to Dampier that he saw the
boat hurled upon the ice. A blinding haze of snow suddenly
shut out everything, and the skipper hastened down
to the deck. He stood beside the wheel for several minutes.
Gazing forward, he could see nothing except the filmy
whiteness and the tops of the seas that had steadily been
getting steeper. The schooner was driving furiously down
upon the ice, but it was evident that to send Wyllard any
assistance was utterly beyond his power. He could have
hove to the schooner while he got the bigger boat over,
and two men might have pulled towards the ice with the
breeze astern of them, but it was perfectly clear that they
could have neither made a landing nor have pulled her
back again. It was also uncertain whether he and the
other man could have brought the schooner round or have
gotten more sail off her. He stood still until they heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
the wash of the sea upon the ice close to lee of them, and
then it was a hard-clenched hand he raised in sign to the
helmsman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the wind! Haul lee sheets!&#8221; he commanded.
</p>
<p>The <i>Selache</i> came round a little, heading off the ice, and
when she drove away with the foam seething white beneath
one depressed rail and the spray whirling high about her
plunging bows, there was a tense look in the white men&#8217;s
faces as they gazed into the thickening white haze to lee
of her. They thrashed her out until Dampier decided that
there was sufficient water between him and the ice, and
then stripped most of the sail off her, and she lay to until
next morning, when they once more got sail on her and ran
in again. The breeze had fallen a little, it was rather
clearer, and they picked up the point, though it had somewhat
changed its shape. They got a boat over, and the
two men who went off in her found a few broken planks,
a couple of oars, and Charly&#8217;s cap washing up and down
in the surf. They had very little doubt as to what that
meant.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>NEWS OF DISASTER</h3>
</div>

<p>When the boat reached the schooner Dampier went off
with one of the men, and with difficulty contrived to make
a landing on the ice only to find it covered with a trackless
sheet of slushy snow. Though Dampier floundered
shorewards a mile or two, there was nothing except the
shattered boat to suggest what had befallen Wyllard
and his companions. The skipper, who retraced his steps
with a heavy heart, retained little hope of seeing them
again. Dampier waited two days until a strong breeze blew
him off the ice, which was rapidly breaking up, and he
then stood out for the open sea, where he hove the <i>Selache</i>
to for a week or so. After that he proceeded northward to
the inlet Wyllard and he had agreed to.
</p>
<p>Dampier was convinced that this was useless, but as the
opening was almost clear of ice he sailed the schooner in,
and spent a week or two scouring the surrounding country.
He found it a desolation, still partly covered with slushy
snow, out of which ridges of volcanic rock rose here and
there. On two of these spots a couple of days&#8217; march from
the schooner, he made a depôt of provisions, and piled a
heap of stones beside them. At times, when it was clear,
he could see the top of a great range high up against the
western sky, but those times were rare. For the most
part, the wilderness was swept by rain or wrapped in
clammy fog.
</p>
<p>There was, however, no sign of Wyllard, and at last
Dampier, coming back jaded and dejected from another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
fruitless search, after the time agreed upon had expired,
shut himself up alone for a couple of hours in the little
cabin. He was certain now that Wyllard and his companions
had been drowned while attempting to make a landing
on the ice, since they would have joined him at the inlet
as arranged had this not been the case. The distance was
by no means great, and there were no Russian settlements
on that part of the coast. The skipper sat very still with
a clenched hand upon the little table, balancing conjecture
against conjecture, and then regretfully decided that there
was only one course open to him. It was dark when he
went up on deck again, but the men were sitting smoking
about the windlass forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can heave some of that cable in, boys,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll clear out for Vancouver at sun-up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men said nothing, but they shipped the levers, and
Dampier went back to the cabin, for the clank of the
windlass and the ringing of the cable jarred upon him.
</p>
<p>Early next morning the <i>Selache</i> stood out to sea, and
once they had left behind them the fog and rain near the
coast, she carried fine weather with her across the Pacific.
On reaching Vancouver, Dampier had some trouble with
the authorities, to whom it was necessary to report the
drowning of three of his crew, but he was more fortunate
than he expected, and after placing the schooner for sale
with a broker, he left the city one evening on the Atlantic
train. Three days later he was driving across the prairie
towards the Hastings homestead. The members were sitting
together in the big general room after supper, when
the wagon Dampier had hired swung into sight over the
crest of a hill.
</p>
<p>It was a still, hot evening, and, as the windows were
open wide, a faint beat of hoofs came up across the tall
wheat and dusty prairie before the wagon topped the rise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Hastings, who sat in a cane chair near the window, with
his pipe in his hand, looked up as he heard it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody driving in,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be
astonished if it&#8217;s Gregory. He talked about coming over
the last time I saw him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If he wants to talk about a deal in wheat, he can stay
away,&#8221; said Mrs. Hastings sharply. &#8220;If all one hears is
true, he has lost quite a few of Harry&#8217;s dollars on the market
lately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings looked troubled at this. &#8220;I&#8217;d sooner think it
was his own money he&#8217;d thrown away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite out of the question. He hasn&#8217;t any.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Hastings, with an air of reflection, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get Sproatly to make inquiries. He&#8217;ll probably be along
with Winifred this evening, and if he finds that Gregory
is getting in rather deep I&#8217;ll have a word or two with him.
I can&#8217;t have him wasting Harry&#8217;s money, and, as one of
the executors, I have a right to protest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha started at the last word. It had an ominous
ring, and she fancied that Hastings had noticed the effect
on her, for he glanced at her curiously. Turning from
him, she rose and walked to the window.
</p>
<p>The wheat stretched across the foreground, tall and
darkly green, and beyond it the white grass ran back to
the hill, which cut sharply against a red and smoky glow.
The sun had gone down some time before, and there was
an exhilarating coolness in the air. Somehow the sight
reminded her of another evening, when she had looked out
across the prairie from a seat at Wyllard&#8217;s table. Almost
a year had passed since then.
</p>
<p>The wagon drew nearer down the long slope of the hill,
and the beat of hoofs that grew steadily louder in a sharp
staccato made the memories clearer. She had heard Dampier
riding in the night Wyllard had received his summons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
and now she wondered who the approaching stranger
was, and what his business could be. She did not know
why, but she thought it was not Gregory.
</p>
<p>Presently Hastings looked round again. &#8220;It&#8217;s the team
Bramfield hires out at the settlement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;None
of our friends would get him to drive them in. There
seem to be two men in the wagon. Bramfield will be one.
I can&#8217;t make out the other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings, who was evidently becoming curious
about the unexpected guest, went to his side, and they
stood watching the wagon until Agatha made an abrupt
movement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Captain Dampier!&#8221; she exclaimed with foreboding
in her voice.
</p>
<p>She stood tensely still, with lips slightly parted, and a
strained look in her eyes, while Hastings gazed at the
wagon for another moment or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, and his voice was harsh, &#8220;it&#8217;s Dampier.
The other man&#8217;s surely Bramfield. Harry&#8217;s not with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He glanced at Agatha, who turned away, and sat down in
the nearest chair. She made no comment, and there was
an oppressive silence, through which the beat of hoofs and
rattle of wheels rang more distinctly.
</p>
<p>It seemed a long time before Dampier came in. He
shook hands with Agatha and Mrs. Hastings diffidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember me?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; answered Mrs. Hastings, with impatience
in her tone. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Harry?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The skipper spread a hard hand out, and sat down
heavily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is what I have to tell you. He asked
me to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked you to?&#8221; questioned Agatha, and though her
voice was strained there was relief in it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>Dampier made a gesture, which seemed to beseech her
patience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if&mdash;anything went wrong&mdash;he told me
I was to come here to Mrs. Hastings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha turned her head away, but Mrs. Hastings saw
that she caught her breath before she cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then something has gone wrong!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About as wrong as it could.&#8221; Dampier met her gaze
gravely. &#8220;Wyllard and two other men are drowned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused as if watching for words that might soften
the dire meaning of his message, and Mrs. Hastings saw
Agatha shiver. The girl turned slowly around with a
drawn white face. It was, however, Hastings who spoke,
almost sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to tell you all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This time it was Agatha who broke in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, with a steadiness that struck the
others as being strained and unnatural, &#8220;you must tell us
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier, who appeared to shrink from his task, began
awkwardly, but he gained coherence and force of expression
as he proceeded. He made them understand something
of the grim resolution which had animated Wyllard.
He pictured, in terse seaman&#8217;s words, the little schooner
plunging to windward over long phalanxes of icy seas, or
crawling white with snow through the blinding fog. His
listeners saw the big combers tumbling ready to break short
upon the dipping bows, and half-frozen men struggling
for dear life with folds of madly thrashing sail. The pictures
were necessarily somewhat blurred and hazy, for
after all only an epic poet could fittingly describe the
things that must be done and borne at sea, and epic poets
are not bred in the forecastle. When he reached the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
scene he gained dramatic power, and Agatha&#8217;s face grew
white and tense. She saw the dim figures pulling the boat
through the flying spray beneath the wall of ice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ran her in,&#8221; he told them, &#8220;with the snow blinding
us. It was working up for a heavy blow, and as we&#8217;d
have to beat her out we couldn&#8217;t take sail off her. We
stood on until we heard the sea along the edge of the ice,
and then there was nothing to do but jam her on the wind
and thrash her clear. There was only a plank or two of
the boat, an oar, and Charly&#8217;s cap, when we came back
again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, though the boat was smashed, they might
have gotten out,&#8221; Hastings suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Dampier simply, &#8220;it didn&#8217;t seem likely.
The ice was sharp and ragged, and there was a long wash
of sea. A man&#8217;s not tough enough to stand much of that
kind of hammering.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s face grew whiter, but Dampier went on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they didn&#8217;t turn up at the inlet
as we&#8217;d fixed, and that decided the thing. If Wyllard had
been alive, he surely would have been there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it just possible that he might have fallen into the
hands of the Russians?&#8221; asked Hastings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I naturally thought of that, but so far as the chart
shows there isn&#8217;t a settlement within leagues of the spot.
Besides, supposing the Russians had got him, how could
I have helped him? They&#8217;d have sent him off in the first
place to one of the bigger settlements in the South, and if
the authorities couldn&#8217;t have connected him with any illegal
sealing they&#8217;d no doubt have managed to send him
across to Japan by and by. In that case, he&#8217;d have gotten
home without any trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dampier paused, and it was significant that he turned
to Agatha with a deprecatory gesture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he added, &#8220;there was nothing I could do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was evident that Agatha acquitted him, but she asked
a question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Dampier,&#8221; she said, &#8220;had you any expectation
of finding those three men when you sailed the second
time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; acknowledged the bronzed sailor, with an impressive
calmness, &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t any, and I don&#8217;t think Wyllard
had either. Still, he meant to make quite certain.
He felt he had to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The skipper gazed at Agatha, and saw comprehension in
her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she observed with an unsteady voice, &#8220;and
when you have said that, you could say very little more
of any man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned her head away from them, and for a few
moments there was a heavy silence in the room. It cost
the girl a painful effort to sit still, apparently unmoved,
but there was strength in her, and she would not betray
her distress. She felt that her grief must be endured
bravely. It was almost overwhelming, but there was mingled
with it a faint consolatory thrill of pride, for it was
clear that the man who had loved her had done a splendid
thing. He had given all that had been given him&mdash;she
knew she would never forget that phrase of his&mdash;willingly,
and it seemed to her that the traits with which he had been
endowed were rare and precious ones. She recognized the
steadfast, unflinching courage, and the fine sense of honor
which had sent him out on that forlorn hope. Unyielding
and undismayed he had gone down to death&mdash;she felt sure
of that&mdash;amid the blinding snow.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings set food before Dampier. By and by
Sproatly and Winifred arrived and they heard the story.
After that Dampier, who had promised to stay with them
a day or two, left Wyllard&#8217;s friends for an hour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me you&#8217;ll naturally want to talk over
things,&#8221; he said; &#8220;if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ll take a stroll
across the prairie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out, and Hastings looked at each member of
the little group with hasty scrutiny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s friends are numerous, but we&#8217;re, perhaps, the
nearest, and, as Dampier said, we have to consider things,&#8221;
he observed, speaking with deliberation. &#8220;To begin with,
there&#8217;s a certain possibility that he has escaped, after all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw the quick movement that Agatha made, and
went on more quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gregory, of course, has control of the Range until we
have proof of Harry&#8217;s death, though Wyllard made a proviso
that if there was no word of the party within eighteen
months after he had sailed, or within six months of the
time Dampier had landed him, we could assume it, after
which the will he handed me would take effect. This, it is
evident, leaves Gregory in charge for some months yet, but
it seems to me it&#8217;s our duty to see he doesn&#8217;t fling away
Harry&#8217;s property. I&#8217;ve reasons for believing that he has
been doing it lately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked at Sproatly, who sat silent a moment or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rather awkwardly placed,&#8221; Sproatly remarked.
&#8220;You see, there&#8217;s no doubt that I&#8217;m indebted to Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred turned to him with impatience in her eyes.
&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said severely, &#8220;you certainly shouldn&#8217;t have
been, and it ought to be quite clear that nobody wishes you
to do anything that would hurt him.&#8221; She looked at
Hastings. &#8220;In case the will takes effect, who does the
property go to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings appeared embarrassed. &#8220;That,&#8221; he objected,
&#8220;is a thing I&#8217;m not warranted in telling you now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A suggestive gleam flashed into Winifred&#8217;s eyes, but it
vanished and her manner became authoritative when she
turned back to Sproatly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you will tell Mr. Hastings all you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly made a gesture of resignation. &#8220;After all,&#8221;
he admitted, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s necessary. Gregory, as I&#8217;ve told
you already, put a big mortgage on his place, and, in view
of the price of wheat and the state of his crop, it&#8217;s evident
that he must have had some difficulty in meeting the interest,
unless&mdash;and one or two things suggest this&mdash;he paid
it with Harry&#8217;s money. Of course, as Harry gave him a
share, there&#8217;s no reason why he shouldn&#8217;t do this so long
as he does not overdraw that share. There&#8217;s no doubt,
however, that he has lost a good deal of money on the
wheat market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he lost any of Harry&#8217;s?&#8221; Mrs. Hastings asked.
</p>
<p>Sproatly hesitated. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s practically certain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred broke in. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she asserted, &#8220;he has lost
a great deal. Hamilton knows almost everything that&#8217;s
going on, and I got it out of him. He&#8217;s a friend of Wyllard&#8217;s,
and seems vexed with Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others did not speak for a moment or two, and then
Mrs. Hastings said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of us don&#8217;t keep much in the bank, and that expedition
must have cost Harry several thousand dollars.
How would Gregory get hold of the money before harvest?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Edmonds, who holds his mortgage, would let him have
it,&#8221; Sproatly explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t he be afraid of Gregory not being able
to pay, if the market went against him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sproatly looked thoughtful. &#8220;The arrangement Wyllard
made with Gregory would, perhaps, give Edmonds a
claim upon the Range if Gregory borrowed any money in
his name. I almost think that&#8217;s what the money-lender is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
scheming for. The man&#8217;s cunning enough for anything.
I don&#8217;t like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings stood up with an air of resolution. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re quite correct. Anyway, I&#8217;ll drive
over in a day or two, and have a talk with Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After that they separated. Hastings strolled away to
join Dampier.
</p>
<p>Sproatly and Winifred walked out on to the prairie.
When they had left the house Sproatly turned to his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you insist upon my telling them what I
did?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; answered Winifred, &#8220;I had several reasons.
For one thing, when I first came out feeling very forlorn
and friendless, it was Wyllard who sent me to the elevator,
and they really treat me very decently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They?&#8221; repeated Sproatly with resentment in his face.
&#8220;If you mean Hamilton, it seems to me that he treats
you with an excess of decency that there&#8217;s no occasion for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred laughed. &#8220;In any case, he doesn&#8217;t drive me
out here every two or three weeks, though&#8221;&mdash;she glanced
at her companion provokingly&mdash;&#8220;he once or twice suggested
that he would like to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you pointed out his presumption?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; confessed Winifred with an air of reflection, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t go quite so far as that. After all, the man is my
employer; I had to handle him tactfully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t be your employer a week after the implement
people open their new depôt,&#8221; returned Sproatly resolutely.
&#8220;But we&#8217;re getting away from the subject. Have
you any more reasons for concerning yourself about what
Gregory does with Wyllard&#8217;s property?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve one; I suppose you don&#8217;t know who he has left
at least a part of it to?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>Sproatly started as an idea crept into his mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you&#8217;re right,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel reasonably sure of it.&#8221; Winifred smiled. &#8220;In
fact, that&#8217;s partly why I don&#8217;t want Gregory to throw
any more of Wyllard&#8217;s money away. You have done all I
expect from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Hastings is to go on with the thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hastings,&#8221; Winifred assured him, &#8220;will fail&mdash;just as
you would. This is a matter which requires to be handled
delicately&mdash;and effectively.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then who is going to undertake it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Winifred laughed. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;a woman,
naturally. I&#8217;m going back by and by to have a word or
two with Mrs. Hastings.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Winifred&#8217;s suspicions soon were proved correct, for Hastings,
who drove over to the Range a day or two after her
visit, returned home rather disturbed in temper after what
he described as a very unsatisfactory interview with Hawtrey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t make the man hear reason,&#8221; he informed
Mrs. Hastings. &#8220;In fact, he practically told me that the
matter was no concern of mine. I assured him that it
concerned me directly as one of the executors of Harry&#8217;s
will, and I&#8217;m afraid I afterwards indulged in a few personalities.
I expect that blamed mortgage-broker has got
a very strong hold on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings looked thoughtful. &#8220;You have never
told me anything about the will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I haven&#8217;t, it wasn&#8217;t for want of prompting,&#8221; returned
Hastings dryly. &#8220;The will was sealed, and handed
to me by Harry on the express understanding that it was
not to be opened until we had proof that he was dead or
until the six months mentioned had expired. If he turned
up it would, of course, be handed back to him. He made
me promise solemnly that I would not offer the least hint
as to its provisions to anybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings indulged in a shrug indicating resignation.
&#8220;In that case I suppose I must be content, but he
might have made an exception of&mdash;me. Anyway, I think
I see how we can put what appears to be a little necessary
pressure upon Gregory.&#8221; She turned again to her husband
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
rather abruptly. &#8220;After all, is it worth while for me to
trouble about the thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings was taken off his guard. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said decidedly,
&#8220;if you can put any pressure on Gregory I guess
it would be very desirable to do it as soon as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think that Harry may turn up, after all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Hastings gravely, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why.
In any case it&#8217;s highly desirable that Gregory shouldn&#8217;t
fling his property away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings smiled. &#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll think
over it. I&#8217;ll probably get Agatha to see what she can do
in the first place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She saw a trace of uncertainty in her husband&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something must be done, but
on the whole I&#8217;d rather you didn&#8217;t trouble Agatha about
the matter. It would be wiser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings asked no more questions. She believed
that she understood the situation, and she had Agatha&#8217;s
interests at heart, for she had grown very fond of the girl.
There was certainly one slight difficulty in the way of
what she meant to do, but she determined to disregard it,
though she admitted that it might, cause Agatha some embarrassment
afterward. When she found the girl alone,
she sat down beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wonder if I may ask whether
you are quite convinced that Harry is dead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She felt that the question was necessary, though it
seemed rather a cruel one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Agatha calmly, &#8220;I can&#8217;t quite bring myself
to believe it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, since you heard what Sproatly said, you would
be willing to do anything that appeared possible to prevent
Gregory throwing Harry&#8217;s money away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Agatha, &#8220;I have been thinking about it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
A sparkle of disdainful anger showed in her eyes. &#8220;Gregory
seems to have been acting shamefully.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then as he won&#8217;t listen to Allen, we must get Sally
to impress that fact on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally?&#8221; questioned Agatha in evident astonishment.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings smiled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you understand
Sally as well as I do. Of course, like the rest of us, she
falls a long way short of perfection, and&mdash;though it&#8217;s a
difficult subject&mdash;there&#8217;s no doubt that her conduct in leading
Gregory on while he was still engaged to you was
hardly quite correct. After all, however, you owe her
something for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t very hard to forgive her for it,&#8221; confessed
Agatha.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I want you to understand Sally. Right or wrong,
she&#8217;s fond of Gregory. Of course, I&#8217;ve told you this already,
but I must try to make it clear how that fact bears
upon the business in hand. Sally certainly fought for
him, and there&#8217;s no doubt that one could find fault with
several things she did; but the point is that she&#8217;s evidently
determined on making the most of him now she has got
him. In some respects, at least, she&#8217;s absolutely straight&mdash;one
hundred cents to the dollar is what Allen says of
her&mdash;and although you might perhaps not have expected
this, I believe it would hurt her horribly to feel that Gregory
was squandering money that didn&#8217;t strictly belong to
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you mean to make her understand what he is
doing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mrs. Hastings; &#8220;I want you to do it.
I&#8217;ve reasons for believing that your influence would go
further with her than mine. For one thing, I fancy she
is feeling rather ashamed of herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha looked thoughtful. She had certainly not credited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
Sally with possessing any fine sense of honor, but she
was willing to accept Mrs. Hastings&#8217; assurance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation,&#8221; she pointed out, &#8220;is rather a delicate
one. You wish to expose Gregory&#8217;s conduct to the girl
he is going to marry, though, as you admit, the explanation
will probably be painful to her. Can&#8217;t you understand
that the course suggested is a particularly difficult
and repugnant one&mdash;to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt of it,&#8221; admitted Mrs. Hastings. &#8220;Still,
I believe it must be adopted&mdash;for several reasons. In the
first place, I think that if we can pull Gregory up now
we shall save him from involving himself irretrievably.
After all, perhaps, you owe him the effort. Then I think
that we all owe something to Harry, and we can, at least,
endeavor to carry out his wishes. He told what was to be
done with his possessions in a will, and he never could
have anticipated that Gregory would dissipate them as he
is doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The least reason, as she had foreseen, proved convincing
to Agatha, and she made a sign of concurrence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will drive me over I will do what I can,&#8221; she
promised.
</p>
<p>Now that she had succeeded, Mrs. Hastings lost no time,
and they set out for the Creighton homestead next day.
Soon after they reached the house she contrived that Sally
should be left alone with Agatha. The two girls stood outside
the house together when Agatha turned to her companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there is something that I must tell
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally glanced at her face, and then walked forward until
the log barn hid them from the house. She sat down upon
a pile of straw and motioned to Agatha to take a place beside
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she observed sharply, &#8220;you can go on; it&#8217;s
about Gregory, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha, who found it very difficult to begin, though she
had been well primed by Hastings on the previous evening,
sat down in the straw, and looked about her for a
moment or two. It was a hot afternoon, dazzlingly bright,
and almost breathlessly still. In front of her the dark
green wheat rolled waist-high, and beyond it the vast sweep
of grass stretched back to the sky-line. Far away a team
and a wagon slowly moved across the prairie, but that was
the only sign of life, and no sound from the house reached
them to break the heavy stillness.
</p>
<p>She finally nerved herself to the effort, and spoke earnestly
for several minutes before she glanced at Sally. It
was evident that Sally had understood all that had been
said, for she sat very still with a hard, set face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Sally exclaimed, &#8220;if I&#8217;d thought you&#8217;d come to
tell me this because you were vexed with me, I&#8217;d know what
to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was what Agatha had dreaded. It certainly looked
as if she had come to triumph over her rival&#8217;s humiliation,
but Sally made it clear that she acquitted her of that intention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Sally, &#8220;I know that wasn&#8217;t the reason, and
I&#8217;m not mad with&mdash;you. It hurts&#8221;&mdash;she made an abrupt
movement&mdash;&#8220;but I know it&#8217;s true.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned to Agatha suddenly. &#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you might save Gregory, if I told you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was all?&#8221; Sally looked at her with incredulous
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Agatha simply, &#8220;that was only part.
It did not seem right that Gregory should go against Wyllard&#8217;s
wishes, and gamble the Range away on the wheat
market.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>She admitted it without hesitation, for she realized now
exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview.
She was fighting Wyllard&#8217;s battle, and that fact
sustained her.
</p>
<p>Sally winced. &#8220;Yes&#8221; she agreed, &#8220;I guess you had to
tell me. He was fond of you. One could be proud of
that. Harry Wyllard never did anything low down and
mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha did not resent her candor. Although this was
a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago,
she saw that the girl felt the contrast between Gregory&#8217;s
character and that of the man whose place he had taken,
and regretted it. Agatha&#8217;s eyes became dim with unshed
tears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wyllard, they think, is dead,&#8221; she said, in a low voice.
&#8220;You have Gregory still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally looked at her with unveiled compassion, and Agatha
did not shrink from it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she declared, with a simplicity that became her,
&#8220;and Gregory must have someone to&mdash;take care of him.
I must do it if I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Agatha was stirred. This
half-taught girl&#8217;s quiet acceptance of the burden that many
women must carry made her almost ashamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will leave it to you,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>It became evident that there was another side to Sally&#8217;s
character, for her manner changed, and the hardness crept
back into her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she admitted, &#8220;I&#8217;d &#8217;most been expecting something
of this kind when I heard that man Edmonds was
going to the Range. He has got a pull on Gregory, but
he&#8217;s surely not going to feel quite happy when I get hold
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rose in another moment, and saying nothing further,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
walked back toward the house, in front of which they
came upon Mrs. Hastings. Sally looked at Mrs. Hastings
significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over to the Range after supper,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings drove away with Agatha. She said little
to the girl during the journey, but an hour after they
had reached the homestead she slipped quietly into Agatha&#8217;s
room. She found her reclining in a big chair sobbing
bitterly. She sat down close beside her, and laid a
hand upon her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Sally could have said anything to trouble
you like this,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>It was a moment or two before Agatha turned a wet,
white face toward her, and saw gentle sympathy in her
eyes. There was, she felt, no cause for reticence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it was the contrast between us. She
has Gregory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hastings showed sympathy and comprehension.
&#8220;And you have lost Harry&mdash;but I think you have not lost
him altogether. We do not know that he is dead&mdash;but
even if it be so, it was all that was finest in him that he
offered you. It is yours still.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She sat silent a moment or two before she went on
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, it is, perhaps, cold comfort, and I am not
sure that I can make what I feel quite clear. Still, Harry
was only human, and it is almost inevitable that, had it
all turned out differently, he would have said and done
things that would have offended you. Now he has left
you a purged and stainless memory&mdash;one, I think, which
must come very near to the reality. The man who went
up there&mdash;for an idea, a fantastic point of honor&mdash;sloughed
off every taint of the baseness that hampers most of us in
doing it. It was a man changed and uplifted above all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
petty things by a high chivalrous purpose, who made that
last grim journey.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha realized the truth of this. Already Wyllard&#8217;s
memory had become etherealized, and she treasured it as a
very fine and precious thing. Still, though he now wore
immortal laurels, that would not content her when all her
human nature cried out for his bodily presence. She
wanted him, as she had grown to love him, in the warm,
erring flesh, and the vague, splendid vision was cold and
remote. There was a barrier greater than that of crashing
ice and bitter water between them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I have felt that. I try to feel it
always&mdash;but just now it&#8217;s not enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned her face away with a bitter sob, and Mrs.
Hastings, who stooped and kissed her, went out of the
room. The older woman knew that the girl had broken
down at last, after months of strain.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It happened that Edmonds, the mortgage-broker, drove
over to the Range, and found Hawtrey waiting for him in
Wyllard&#8217;s room. It was early in the evening, and he could
see the hired men busy outside tossing prairie hay from the
wagons into the great barn. The men were half-naked
and grimed with dust, but Hawtrey, who was dressed in
store clothes, evidently had taken no share in their labors.
When Edmonds came in he turned to the money-lender
with anxiety in his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he questioned brusquely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Market&#8217;s a little stiffer,&#8221; said Edmonds.
</p>
<p>Edmonds sat down and stretched out his hand toward
the cigar-box on the table, while Hawtrey waited with
very evident impatience.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still moving up?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Edmonds nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s the other folks&#8217; last stand,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
declared. &#8220;With the wheat ripening as it&#8217;s doing, the
flood that will pour in before the next two months are out
will sweep them off the market. I was half afraid from
your note that this little rally had some weight with you,
and that as one result of it you meant to cover now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; admitted Hawtrey, &#8220;was in my mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; remarked his companion, &#8220;it&#8217;s a pity.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey leaned upon the table with hesitation in his
face and attitude. He had neither the courage nor the
steadfastness to make a gambler, and every fluctuation of
the market swayed him to and fro. He had a good deal
of wheat to deliver by and by, and he could still secure
a very desirable margin if he bought in against his sales
now. Unfortunately, however, he had once or twice lost
heavily in an unexpected rally, and he greatly desired to
recoup himself. Then, he had decided, nothing could
tempt him to take part in another deal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I hold on and the market stiffens further I&#8217;ll be
awkwardly fixed,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Wyllard made a will,
and in a few months I&#8217;ll have to hand everything over to
his executors. There would naturally be unpleasantness
over a serious shortage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds smiled. He had handled his man cleverly,
and had now a reasonably secure hold upon him and the
Range, but he was far from satisfied. If Hawtrey made
a further loss he would in all probability become irretrievably
involved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he pointed out, &#8220;there&#8217;s every reason why you
should try to get straight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey admitted it. &#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
feel sure I could do it by holding on?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds seldom answered such a question. It was apt
to lead to unpleasantness afterwards.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Beeman, and Oliphant, and Barstow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
are operating for a fall. One would fancy that you
were safe in doing what they do. When men of their
weight sell forward figures go down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was correct, as far as it went, but Edmonds was
quite aware that the gentlemen referred to usually played
a very deep and obscure game. He had also reasons for
believing that they were doing it now. It was, however,
evident that Hawtrey&#8217;s hesitation was vanishing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big hazard, but I feel greatly tempted to hang
on,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Edmonds, who disregarded his remark, sat smoking
quietly. Since he was tolerably certain as to what the result
would be, he felt that it was now desirable to let Hawtrey
decide for himself, in which case it would be impossible
to reproach him afterwards. Wheat, it seemed very
probable, would fall still further when the harvest began,
but he had reasons for believing that the market would
rally first. In that case Hawtrey, who had sold forward
largely, would fall altogether into his hands, and he looked
forward with very pleasurable anticipation to enforcing
his claim upon the Range. In the meanwhile he was unobtrusively
watching Hawtrey&#8217;s face, and it had become
evident that in another moment or two his victim would
adopt the course suggested, when there was a rattle of
wheels outside. Edmonds, who saw a broncho team and a
a wagon appear from behind the barn, realized that he
must decide the matter without delay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I want to reach Lander&#8217;s before it&#8217;s dark I&#8217;ll have
to get on,&#8221; he said carelessly. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll give me a letter
to the broker, I&#8217;ll send it to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Next moment a clear voice rose somewhere outside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you needn&#8217;t worry,&#8221; it said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go right in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Sally walked into the room.
</p>
<p>Edmonds was disconcerted, but bowed, and then sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
down again, quietly determined to wait, for he discovered
that there was hostility in the swift glance she flashed at
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite a smart team you were driving, Miss
Creighton,&#8221; he remarked.
</p>
<p>Sally, who disregarded this, turned to Hawtrey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he doing here?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He came over on a little matter of business,&#8221; answered
Hawtrey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been selling wheat again?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey looked embarrassed, for her manner was
not conciliatory. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;I have sold
some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wheat you haven&#8217;t got?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey did not answer, and Sally sat down. Her
manner suggested that she meant thoroughly to investigate
the matter, and Edmonds, who would have greatly preferred
to get rid of her, decided that as it appeared impossible
he would appeal to her cupidity. The Creightons
were grasping folk, and he had heard of her engagement
to Hawtrey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will permit me I&#8217;ll try to explain,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll say that you have reason for believing that wheat
will go down and you tell a broker to sell it forward at a
price a little below the actual one. If other people do the
same it drops faster, and before you have to deliver you can
buy it in at less than you sold it at. A great deal of money
can be picked up that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks easy,&#8221; Sally agreed, with something in her
manner which led him to fancy he might win her over.
&#8220;Of course, prices have been falling. Gregory has been
selling down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He has. In fact, there&#8217;s already a big margin to his
credit,&#8221; declared Edmonds unsuspectingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is, if he bought in now he&#8217;d have cleared&mdash;several
thousand dollars?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds told her exactly how much, and then started
in sudden consternation with rage in his heart, for she
turned to Hawtrey imperiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll write your broker to buy in right away,&#8221;
she said.
</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence, during which the two
men looked at each other until Edmonds spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you wise in suggesting this, Miss Creighton?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>Sally laughed harshly. &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;it&#8217;s a
sure thing. And I don&#8217;t suggest. I tell him to get it
done.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She turned again to Hawtrey, who sat very still looking
at her with a flush in his face. &#8220;Take your pen and give
him that letter to the broker now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was this in her favor that Hawtrey was to some
extent relieved by her persistence. He had not the courage
to make a successful speculator, and he had already
felt uneasy about the hazard that he would incur by waiting.
Besides, although prices had slightly advanced, he
could still secure a reasonable margin if he covered his
sales. In any case, he did as she bade him, and in another
minute or two he handed Edmonds an envelope.
</p>
<p>The broker took it from him without protest, for he was
one who could face defeat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, with a gesture of resignation, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
send the thing on. If Miss Creighton will excuse me, I&#8217;ll
tell your man to get out my wagon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He went out, and Sally turned to Hawtrey with the color
in her cheeks and a flash in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Harry Wyllard&#8217;s money!&#8221; she commented, as she
met his glance with flashing eyes.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>IN THE WILDERNESS</h3>
</div>

<p>A bitter wind was blowing when Wyllard stood outside
the little tent the morning after he had made a landing
on the ice. He was to leeward of the straining canvas which
partly sheltered him, but the raw cold struck through him
to the bone, and he was stiff and sore from his exertions
during the previous day. His joints ached unpleasantly,
and his clothing had not quite dried upon him. He was
conscious of a strong desire to crawl back into the tent
and go to sleep again, but that was one it would clearly
not be wise to indulge in, since they were, he believed, still
some distance off the beach, and the ice might begin to
break up at any moment. It stretched away before him,
seamed by fissures and serrated ridges here and there, for a
few hundred yards, and then was lost in the snow. As he
gazed at it he shrank from the prospect of the journey
through the frozen desolation.
</p>
<p>With a shiver he crawled back into the tent where his
two companions were crouching beside the cooking-lamp.
The feeble light of its sputtering blue flame touched their
faces, which were graver than usual, but Charly looked up
as he came in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind&#8217;s dropping,&#8221; announced Wyllard curtly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll start as soon as you have made breakfast. We
must try to reach the beach to-night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly made no answer, though the dusky-skinned Siwash
grunted, and in a few more minutes they silently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
commenced their meal, which was promptly finished. They
struck the tent, and packed it with their sleeping-bags and
provisions upon the sled, and then, taking up the traces,
set out across the ice. The light had grown clearer now,
and the snow was thinning, but it still whirled about them,
and lay piled in drawn-out wreaths to lee of every hummock
or ragged ridge. They floundered knee-deep, and in
the softer places the weight upon the traces grew unpleasantly
heavy. That, however, was not a thing any of them
felt the least desire to complain of, and it was indeed a
matter of regret to them that they were not harnessed to
a heavier burden. There was a snow-wrapped desolation
in front of them, and they had lost a number of small
comforts and part of their provisions in making a landing.
Whether the provisions could be replaced they did not
know.
</p>
<p>The small supply of food was an excellent reason for
pushing on as fast as possible, and they stumbled and
floundered forward until late in the afternoon. The ice
became more rugged and broken as they proceeded. The
snow had ceased, but the drifts which stretched across their
path were plentiful, and they were in the midst of one
when it seemed to Wyllard, who was leading, that they were
sinking much deeper than usual. The snow was over the
tops of his long boots, the sled seemed very heavy, and
he could hear his comrades floundering savagely. There
was a cry behind him, and he was jerked suddenly backwards
for a pace or two until he flung himself down at
full length in the snow. After that he was drawn back no
further, but the strain upon the trace became almost insupportable,
and there was still a furious scuffling behind
him.
</p>
<p>In a moment or two, however, the strain slackened, and
looking round, he saw Charly waist-deep in the snow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Charly struggled out with difficulty, holding on by the
trace, but the sled had vanished, and it was with grave misgivings
that Wyllard scrambled to his feet. They hauled
with all their might, and after a tense effort, that left
them gasping, dragged the sled back into sight. Part of
its load, however, had been left behind in the yawning hole.
</p>
<p>Charly went back a pace or two cautiously until he once
more sank to the waist, and they had some trouble in dragging
him clear. Then he sat down on the sled, and Wyllard
stood still looking at the holes in the snow.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you feel anything under you?&#8221; he asked at length
in a jarring voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Charly simply. &#8220;It was only the trace
saved me from dropping through altogether, but if I&#8217;d gone
a little further I&#8217;d have been in the water. Kind of snow
bridge over a crevice. We broke it up, and the sled fell
through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard turned and flung the tent, their sleeping-bags,
and the few packages which had not fallen out of the sled,
after which he hastily opened one or two of them. His
companions looked at them with apprehension in their
eyes until he spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The provisions may last a week or so, if we cut down
rations,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>He could not remember afterwards whether anybody
suggested it, and he believed that the same idea occurred
to all of them at once, but in another moment or two they
set about undoing the traces from the sled, and making
them secure about their bodies. For half an hour they
made perilous attempt after attempt to recover the lost
provisions, and failed. The snow broke through continuously
beneath the foremost man, but it did not break away
altogether, and they could not tell what lay beneath it when
they had drawn him out of the hole. When it became evident
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
that the attempt was useless, sitting on the sled, they
held a brief council.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we don&#8217;t want to go back,&#8221; said Charly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
quite likely we&#8217;ve crossed a good many of these crevices,
and the snow&#8217;s getting soft. Besides, Dampier will have
hauled off and headed for the inlet by now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He spoke quietly, though his face was grave. Pausing
a moment, he waved his hand. &#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;we have got to fetch the inlet while the provisions
last.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; agreed Wyllard. &#8220;Since the chart shows
a river between us and it, the sooner we start the better.
If the thaw holds, the stream will break up the ice on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Indian, who made no suggestion, grunted what appeared
to be concurrence, and they silently set to work to
reload the sled. That done, they took up the traces and
floundered on again into the gathering dimness and a thin
haze of driving snow. Darkness had fallen when they made
camp again, and sat, worn-out and aching in every bone,
about the sputtering lamp inside the little straining tent.
The meal they made was a very frugal one, and they lay
down in the darkness after it, for half their store of oil had
been left behind in the crevice. They spoke seldom, for
the second disaster had almost crushed the courage out of
them, and it was clear to all that it would be only by a
strenuous effort that they could reach the inlet before their
provisions quite ran out. They slept, however, and rising
in a stinging frost next morning set out again on the weary
march, but it was slow traveling, and at noon they left
the tent and poles behind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In another few days,&#8221; said Wyllard, &#8220;we&#8217;ll leave the
sled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They made the beach that afternoon, though the only
sign of it was the fringe of more ragged ice and the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
slope beyond. A thin haze hung about them heavy with
rime, and they could not see more than a quarter of a mile
ahead. When darkness fell they scraped out a hollow beneath
what seemed to be a snow-covered rock, and sat upon
their sleeping-bags. The cooking-lamp gave little heat.
Having eaten, they huddled close together with part of
their aching bodies upon the sled, but none of them slept
much that night, for the cold was severe.
</p>
<p>The morning broke clear and warmer, and Wyllard,
climbing to the summit of the rock, had a brief glimpse of
the serrated summits of a great white range that rose to
the west and south. It, however, faded like a vision while
he watched it, and turning he looked out across the rolling
wilderness that stretched away to the north. Nothing
broke its gleaming monotony, and there was no sign of
life anywhere in the vast expanse.
</p>
<p>They set out after breakfast, breaking through a thin
crust of snow, which rendered the march almost insuperably
difficult, and they had made a league or two by the
approach of night. The snow had grown softer, and the
thawing surface would not bear the sled, which sank in the
slush beneath. Still, they floundered on for a while after
darkness fell, and then lay down in a hollow. A fine rain
poured down on them.
</p>
<p>Somehow they slept, and, though this was more difficult,
got upon their feet again when morning came, for of
all the hard things the wanderer in rain-swept bush or
frozen wilderness must bear, there is none that tests his
powers more than, in the early dawn, the bracing of himself
for another day of effort. Comfortless as the night&#8217;s
lair has been, the jaded body craves for such faint warmth
as it afforded, and further rest; the brain is dull and
heavy, and the aching limbs appear incapable of supporting
the weight on them. Difficulties loom appallingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
large in the faint creeping light, courage fails, and the will
grows feeble. Wyllard and his companions felt all this,
but it was clear to them that they could not dally, with
their provisions out, and staggering out of camp after a
very scanty meal they hauled the sled through the slush
for an hour or so. Then they had stopped, gasping, and
the Indian slipped out of the traces.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve hauled that thing about far enough,&#8221; said
Charly, who dropped the traces, too, and slipped away from
the sled.
</p>
<p>Wyllard stood looking at them for a moment or two with
anxious eyes. It was evident that they could haul the
hampering load no further, and he was troubled by an almost
insupportable weariness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have to decide what you&#8217;ll
leave behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They discussed the subject for some minutes, partly because
it furnished an excuse for sitting upon the sled,
though none of them had much doubt as to the result of
the council. It was unthinkable that they should sacrifice
a scrap of the provisions. Then, when each man had
lashed a light load upon his shoulders with a portion of
the cut-up traces, they set out again, and it rained upon
them heavily all that day.
</p>
<p>During the four following days they were buffeted by a
furious wind, but the temperature had risen, and the snow
was melting fast, and splashing knee-deep through slush
and water they made progress. While he stumbled along
with the pack-straps galling his shoulders, Wyllard was
conscious of little beyond the unceasing pain in his joints
and the leaden heaviness of his limbs. The recollection of
that march haunted him like a horrible nightmare long
afterwards, when each sensation and incident emerged
from the haze of numbing misery. He remembered that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
he stormed at Charly, who lagged behind now and then in
a fit of languid dejection, and that once he fell heavily,
and was sensible of a half-conscious regret that he was still
capable of going on, when the Indian dragged him to his
feet again. They rarely spoke to one another, and noticed
nothing beyond the strip of white waste, through which
uncovered brown patches commenced to break, immediately
in front of them, except when they crossed some low
elevation and looked down upon the stretch of dull gray
water not far away on one hand. The breeze had swept
the ice away, and that was reassuring, because it meant
that Dampier would be at the inlet when they reached it,
though now and then a horrible fear that their strength
would fail them or that their provisions would run out first,
crept in.
</p>
<p>Their faces had grown gaunt and haggard, and each
scanty meal had been cut down to the smallest portion
which would keep life and power of movement within
them. Still, though the weight of it hampered him almost
intolerably, Wyllard clung to the one rifle that they
had saved from the disaster at the landing and a dozen
cartridges. This was a folly about which he and Charly
once had virulent words.
</p>
<p>At last they came to a river which flowed across their
path, and lay down beside it, feeling that the end was not
far away. Except in the eddies and shallows, the ice had
broken up, and the stream swirled by in raging flood, thick
with heavy masses which it had brought down from its
higher reaches. The ice crashed upon the gleaming spurs
that here and there projected from the half-thawed fringe,
and smashed with a harsh crackling among the boulders,
and there was no doubt as to what would befall the stoutest
swimmer who might attempt the passage. So far as Wyllard
afterwards remembered, none of them said anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
when they lay down among the wet stones, but with the
first of the daylight they started up stream. The river was
not a large one, and it seemed just possible that they might
find a means of crossing higher up, though they afterwards
admitted that this was a great deal more than they expected.
</p>
<p>The ground rose sharply, and the stream flowed out of
a deep ravine which they followed. The rocks were of
volcanic origin, and some of them had crumbled into heaps
of ragged débris. The slope of the ravine became a talus
along which it was almost impossible to scramble, and they
were forced back upon the boulders and the half-thawed ice
in the slacker pools.
</p>
<p>They made progress, notwithstanding all the obstacles
in their way, and when evening drew near found a little
clearer space between rock and river. The Indian had
wrenched his knee, and when they stopped to make camp
among the rocks it was some little time before he overtook
them. He said that he had found the tracks of some animal
which he believed had gone up the ravine. What the
beast was he did not know, but he was sure that it was, at
least, large enough to eat, and that appeared to be of the
most importance then. He would not, however, take the
rifle. Nothing could compel him to drag himself another
rod that night, he said, and the others, who had noticed
how he limped, accepted his decision. With an expressionless
face he sat down among the stones, and Charly
decided that it was Wyllard&#8217;s part to pick the trail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You could beat me every time at trailing or shooting
when we went ashore on the American side, and I&#8217;m
not sorry to let it go at that now,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Wyllard smiled grimly. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve carried this rifle a
week on top of my other load. You can&#8217;t shoot when
you&#8217;re dead played out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>They called in the Indian and gave the rifle to him.
He gravely pointed to Wyllard.
</p>
<p>Charly grinned for the first time in several days.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;in this case I guess I&#8217;ve no
objections to let it be as he suggests.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard resignedly took up the rifle and strode wearily
out of camp. There was, he knew, scarcely an hour&#8217;s daylight
left, and already the dimness seemed a little more
marked down in the hollow. He, however, found the place
where the Indian had seen the animal&#8217;s track, and as
there was a wall of rock on one side, up which he believed
the beast could not scramble, he pushed on up stream beside
the ice. There was nothing to guide him, but he was a
little surprised to feel that his perceptions, which had been
dull and dazed for the last few days, were growing clearer.
He noticed the different sounds the river made, and picked
out the sharp crackle of ice among the stones, though he
had hitherto been conscious only of a hoarse, pulsating
roar. The rocks also took distinctive shapes instead of
looming in blurred masses before his heavy eyes, and he
found himself gazing with strained attention into each
strip of deeper shadow. Still, though he walked cautiously,
there was no sign of any life in the ravine. He
was horribly weary, and now and then he set his lips as
he stumbled noisily among the stones, but he pushed on
beside the water while the deep hollow grew dimmer and
more shadowy.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE UNEXPECTED</h3>
</div>

<p>After a hard tramp Wyllard felt a troublesome dizziness
creeping over him, and he sat down upon a boulder with
the rifle across his knees. He had eaten little in the last
few days, which had been spent in arduous exertion, and
now the leaden weariness which he had fought against
since morning threatened to overcome him. In addition
to this, he was oppressed by a black dejection, which,
though his mind had never been clearer, reacted upon
his failing physical powers, for it was now evident that
he and his companions could not reach the inlet while
their provisions held out. There was no longer any doubt
that he had involved the two faithful men in disaster, and
the knowledge that he had done so was bitter.
</p>
<p>With haggard face he sat gazing up the ravine. Although
he scarcely imagined that either of the others had
expected anything, he shrank from going back as empty-handed
as when he had left them. The light was getting
very dim, but he could still see the ice fringe upon the
pool in front of him, and a mass of rock that rose black
against the creeping dusk not very far away. Beyond it
on the one side there seemed to be a waste of stones amid
which a few wreaths of snow still gleamed lividly. Then
a wall of rock scarcely distinguishable in the shadow shut
in the hollow.
</p>
<p>The hollow was filled with the hoarse roar of the river
and the sharp crash and crackle of stream-driven ice, but
by and by the worn-out man started as he caught another
faint sound which suggested the clink of a displaced stone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
His hands closed hard upon the rifle, but he sat very still,
listening with strained attention until he heard the sound
again. Then a thrill ran through him, for he was quite
certain of it&#8217;s meaning. A stone had rolled over higher
up the gorge, and he rose and crept forward, cautiously,
keeping the detached rock between him and the upper
portion of the ravine. Once or twice a stone clattered
noisily beneath his feet, and he stopped for a moment or
two, wondering with tense anxiety whether the sound
could be heard at any distance through the roar of the
river. This was a much more serious business than crawling
through the long grass for a shot at the prairie antelope,
when in ease of success it had seemed scarcely worth
while to pack the tough and stringy venison back to the
homestead.
</p>
<p>By and by he heard the clatter of a displaced stone
again, and this time the sound was so distinct and near
that it puzzled him. The wild creatures of the waste were,
he knew, always alert, and their perception of an approaching
danger was wonderful. It seemed strange that the
beast he was creeping in upon could not hear him, but
he realized that he must face the hazard of detection, since
in another few minutes it would be too dark to shoot. He
had almost reached the rock by this time, and he shifted
his grasp on the rifle, holding it thrust forward in front
of him while crouching low he looked down for a spot on
which to set his foot each time he moved. It would, he
knew, be useless to go any further if a stone turned over
now. He was fortunate, however, and, strung up to
highest tension, he stole into the deeper gloom behind the
rock.
</p>
<p>A little pool ran in close beneath the rock, but it was
covered with ice and slushy snow. Treading cautiously,
he crept across it, and held his breath as he moved out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
from behind the rock. He stopped suddenly, for a man
stood face to face with him scarcely a stone&#8217;s throw away.
The stranger&#8217;s fur-clad figure cut sharply against a gleaming
back of snow, and he held a gun in his hand. Though
the light had almost gone, it was evident to Wyllard that
he was a white man.
</p>
<p>They stood very still for several seconds gazing at each
other, and then the stranger dropped the butt of his weapon
and called out sharply, uttering words in a tongue that
Wyllard did not recognize. Wyllard did not move and
the man spoke again. What he said was still unintelligible,
but this time Wyllard knew that he was trying German.
When he received only a shake of the head as an
answer, the stranger tried again. This time is was French
that he spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can come forward, comrade,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>He did not seem to be hostile, and Wyllard, who tossed
his rifle into the hollow of his left arm, moved out a pace
or two to meet him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are Russian?&#8221; he questioned in the language the
other had used, for French is freely spoken in parts of
Canada.
</p>
<p>The man laughed. &#8220;That afterwards,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is said so. My name is Overweg&mdash;Albrecht Overweg.
As to you, it appears you do not understand Russian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard drew a little nearer, and sat down upon a
boulder. Now that the tension had slackened, his weariness
had once more become almost insupportable, and he
felt that he might need his strength and senses. He was
bewildered by the encounter, for it was certainly astonishing
in that desolate wilderness to fall in with a man who
spoke three civilized languages and wore spectacles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied, after a slight pause, &#8220;it is almost the
first time I have heard Russian spoken.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; responded the other, &#8220;there is a certain significance
in that admission, my friend. May I inquire where
you have come from, and what you are doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard, who had no desire to give him any information
concerning the quest for his lost comrades, pointed towards
the east.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is where I come from. As to my business at
the moment you will excuse me. It is perhaps not a rudeness
to ask what is yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger laughed. &#8220;Caution, it seems, is necessary;
and to the east, where you have pointed, there is only the
sea. I will, however, tell you my business. It is science,
and not&#8221;&mdash;he seemed to add this with a certain significance&mdash;&#8220;in
any way connected with the administration of
the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard was conscious of a vast relief on hearing this,
but as he was not quite sure that he could believe it, he
felt that prudence was still advisable. In any case, he
could not let the stranger go away until he had learned
whether there were any more white men with him. He
sat still, thinking hard for a moment or two.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a camp somewhere near?&#8221; he asked at
length.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied the man. &#8220;You will come back
with me, or shall I come to yours?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several of you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides myself, two Kamtchadales.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Wyllard, &#8220;I will come with you. I have
left two comrades a little further down the ravine. Will
you wait until I bring them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The stranger made a sign of assent, and sitting down
upon a ledge of rock took out a cigar. Wyllard now felt
more sure of him, since it was evident that had he meditated
any treachery he would naturally have preferred him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
to make the visit unattended. In any case, it seemed likely
that he would have something to eat in his camp.
</p>
<p>Wyllard plodded back down the ravine, and when he returned
with his comrades Overweg was still sitting there in
the gathering darkness. He greeted them with a wave of his
hand, and rising, silently led the way up the hollow until
they came in sight of a little tent that glimmered beneath
a rock. There was a light inside the tent and two dusky
figures were silhoueted against the canvas. Overweg drew
the flap back, and the light shone upon his face as he signed
them to enter. Wyllard, standing still a moment, looked
at him steadily, and then, seeing a reassuring smile,
went in.
</p>
<p>Overweg called to one of the Kamtchadales, who came
in and busied himself about the cooking-lamp. The three
famished men sat down with a sense of luxurious content
among the skins that were spread upon the ground sheet.
After the raw cold outside the tent was very snug and
warm. Wyllard said little, however, and Overweg made
no attempt at conversation until the Kamtchadale laid out
a meal, when he watched his guests with a smile while they
ate voraciously. He had stripped off his furs, and with
his knees drawn up sat on one of the skins. He was a
little, plump, round-faced man, with tow-colored hair, and
eyes that gleamed shrewdly behind his spectacles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I open another can?&#8221; he asked presently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Wyllard. &#8220;We owe you thanks
enough already. Provisions are evidently plentiful with
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg nodded. &#8220;I have a base camp two or three
days&#8217; journey back,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;It is possible that I
shall make a depôt. We brought our stores up from the
south with dog sleds before the snow grew soft, but it is
necessary for me to push on further. My business, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
understand, is the scientific survey; to report upon the
natural resources of the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, and his manner changed a little when he
went on again. &#8220;I have,&#8221; he added, &#8220;to this extent taken
you into my confidence, and I invite an equal candor. Two
things are evident. You have made a long journey, and
your French is not that one hears in Paris.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all,&#8221; said Wyllard, &#8220;I must ask again, are you
a Russian?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;My name, which I
have told you, is not Slavonic, and it may be admitted
that I was born in Bavaria. In the meanwhile, it is true
that I have been sent on a mission by the Russian Government.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; remarked Wyllard reflectively, &#8220;how far
you consider your duty towards your employers goes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;It covers all that can be ascertained
about the geological structure and the fauna of
the country, especially the fauna that produce marketable
furs. At present I am not convinced that it goes very
much further.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was clear to Wyllard that he was already in this man&#8217;s
hands, since he could not reach the inlet without provisions,
and Overweg could, if he thought fit, send back a
messenger to the Russian authorities. He was one who
could think quickly and make a momentous decision, and
he realized that if he could not win the man&#8217;s sympathy
there must be open hostility between them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case I think I may tell you what has brought
me here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you have traveled much in Kamtchatka
you can, perhaps, help me. To begin with, I sailed
from Vancouver, in Canada, nearly a year ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It required some time to make his errand clear, and then
Overweg looked at him with an inscrutable expression.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said the scientist, &#8220;a tale that in these days one
finds some little difficulty in believing. Still, it must be
admitted that I am acquainted with one fact which appears
to substantiate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he saw the blood rise to Wyllard&#8217;s forehead he broke
off with a laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is it permitted to offer you
my felicitations? The men who would attempt a thing
of this kind are, I think, singularly rare.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the fact that gives me at least partial credence?&#8221;
asked Wyllard, impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a Kamtchadale in my base camp who told me
of a place where a white man was buried some distance to
the west of us. He spoke of a second white man, but nobody,
I understand, knows what became of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard straightened himself suddenly. &#8220;You will
send for that Kamtchadale?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuredly. The tale you have told me has stirred my
curiosity. As my path lies west up the river valley, we
can, if it pleases you, go on for a while together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard, who thanked him, turned to Charly with a sigh
of relief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that we shall not bring those men back, but
I think we may find out where they lie,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Charly made no comment, for this was the most he had
expected, and a few minutes later there was silence in the
little tent when the men lay down to sleep among the
skins.
</p>
<p>They started at sunrise next morning, and followed the
river slowly by easy stages until the man sent back to
Overweg&#8217;s base camp overtook them with another Kamtchadale.
Then they pushed on still further inland, and it
was a week later when one evening their guide led them
up to a little pile of stones upon a lonely ridge of rock.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
There were two letters very rudely cut on one of the stones,
and Wyllard, who stooped down beside it, took off his cap
when he rose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that Jake Leslie lies here,&#8221; he said.
Looking at Overweg, he asked, &#8220;Your man is sure there
was only one white man who buried him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg spoke to the Kamtchadale, who answered:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was only one white man. It seems he went inland
afterwards&mdash;at least a year ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard turned to Charly, and his face was very grave.
&#8220;That makes it certain that two of them have died. There
was one left, and he may be dead by this time.&#8221; He made
a forceful gesture. &#8220;If one only knew!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly made no answer. He was not a man of education
or much imagination, but like others of his kind he
had alternately borne many privations in the wilderness,
logging, prospecting, trail-cutting about the remoter
mines, and at sea. As one result of this there crept into
his mind some recognition of what the outcast who lay
at rest beside their feet had had to face&mdash;the infinite toil
of the march, the black despair, the blinding snow, and
Arctic frost. He met his leader&#8217;s gaze with a look of comprehending
sympathy.
</p>
<p>By what grim efforts and primitive devices their comrade
had clung to life for a time, it seemed probable they
would never know, but they clearly realized that, though
some might call it an illegal raid, or even piracy, it was
a work of mercy this outlaw had undertaken when he was
cast away. In the command to swing the boats over and
face the roaring surf in the darkness of the night he had
heard the clear call of duty, and had fearlessly obeyed.
His obedience had cost him much, but as the man who had
come so far to search for him looked down upon the little
pile of stones there in the desolate wilderness, there awoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
within him a sure recognition of the fact that this was not
the end. That, at least, was unthinkable. His comrade,
putting off the half-frozen, suffering flesh, had gone on to
join the immortals with his duty done.
</p>
<p>It was with warmth at his heart and a slight haziness in
his eyes that Wyllard turned away at length, but when he
put on his fur cap again he was more determined than ever
to carry out the search. There were many perils and difficulties
to be faced, but he felt that he must not flinch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One man went inland,&#8221; he said to Overweg. &#8220;I must
go that way, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The little spectacled scientist looked at him curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;the road your comrade traveled is
a hard one. You have seen what it leads to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Wyllard gave another a glimpse of the emotion
that he generally kept hidden deep in him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, quietly, &#8220;the hard road leads further&mdash;where
we do not know&mdash;but one feels that the full knowledge
will not bring sorrow when it is some day given to
those who have the courage to follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg waved a hand as he spoke. &#8220;It is not the view
of the materialists, but it is conceivable that the materialists
may be wrong,&#8221; he responded. &#8220;In this case, however,
it is the concrete and practical we have to grapple
with, my friend. You say you are going inland to search
for that man, and for a while I go that way, but though I
have my base camp there is the question of provisions if
you come with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They discussed the matter until Wyllard suggested that
he could replace any provisions his companion supplied
him with from the schooner, to which Overweg agreed,
and they afterwards decided to send the Siwash and one
of the Kamtchadales on to the inlet with a letter to Dampier.
The two messengers started next day, when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
found a place where the river was with difficulty fordable,
and the rest pushed on slowly into a broken and rising
country seamed with belts of thin forest here and there.
They held westwards for another week, and then one evening
made their camp among a few stunted, straggling firs.
The temperature had risen in the daytime, but the nights
were cold, and when they had eaten their evening meal
they were glad of the shelter of the tent. A small fire of
resinous branches was sinking into a faintly glowing mass
close outside the canvas.
</p>
<p>The flap was drawn back, and Wyllard, who lay facing
the opening, could see a triangular patch of dim blue sky
with a sharp sickle moon hanging low above a black fir
branch. The night was clear and still, but now and then
among the stunted trees there was a faint elfin sighing that
quickly died away again. While still determined, Wyllard
was moodily discouraged, for they had seen no sign of
human life during the journey, and his reason told him
that he might search for years before he found the bones
of the last survivor of the party. Still, he meant to search
while Overweg was willing to supply him with provisions.
</p>
<p>By and by he saw Charly sharply raise his head and gaze
towards the opening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear anything outside?&#8221; asked Charly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be the Kamtchadales,&#8221; Wyllard answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They went back a mile or two to lay some traps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Wyllard, decisively, &#8220;it couldn&#8217;t have
been anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly did not appear satisfied, and it seemed to Wyllard
that Overweg was also listening, but there was deep
stillness outside now, and he dismissed the matter from
his mind. A few minutes later, however, it seemed to him
that a shadowy form appeared out of the gloom among the
firs and faded into it again. This struck him as very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
curious, since if it had been one of the Kamtchadales he
would have walked straight into camp, but he said nothing
to his companions, and there was silence for a while until
Charly rose softly to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out as quietly as you can,&#8221; he said, as he slipped
by Wyllard, who crept after him to the entrance.
</p>
<p>When he reached it Wyllard&#8217;s voice rang out with a
startling vehemence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop right now,&#8221; he cried, and after a pause, &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s
going to hurt you. Walk right ahead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard felt his heart beat furiously, for a dusky, half-seen
figure materialized out of the gloom, and grew into
sharper form as it drew nearer to the sinking fire. The
thing was wholly unexpected, almost incredible, but it was
clear that the man could understand English, and his face
was white. In another moment Wyllard&#8217;s last doubt vanished,
and he sprang forward with a gasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewson&mdash;Tom Lewson!&#8221; he cried.
</p>
<p>Charly thrust the man inside the tent, and when somebody
lighted a lamp Lewson sat down stupidly and looked
at them. His face was gaunt and almost blackened by exposure
to the frost, his hair was long, and tattered garments
of greasy skins hung about him. There was something
that suggested bewildered incredulity in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s real?&#8221; he said, slowly and haltingly. &#8220;You have
come at last?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They assured him that this was the case. For a moment
or two the man&#8217;s face was distorted with a strange look
and he made a hoarse sound in his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; he muttered! &#8220;if I&#8217;m dreaming I don&#8217;t want
to wake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly leaned forward and smote him on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I hit you like I did that afternoon in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
Thompson House on the Vancouver water front?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>Then the certainty of the thing seemed to dawn upon
the man, for he quivered, and his eyes half closed. After
that he straightened himself with an effort.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have known, and I think I did,&#8221; he said, turning
to Wyllard. &#8220;Something seemed to tell me that you
would come for us when you could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard&#8217;s face flushed, but he made no answer, and it
was Charly who asked the next question:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The others are dead?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lewson made an expressive gesture. &#8220;Hopkins was
drowned in a crevice of the ice. I buried Leslie back yonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly, as though speech cost him an effort,
and Wyllard turned to Overweg.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the last of the men I was looking for,&#8221; he announced.
</p>
<p>Overweg quietly nodded. &#8220;Then you have my felicitations&mdash;but
it might be advisable if you did not tell me
too much,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Afterwards I may be questioned
by those in authority.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>CAST AWAY</h3>
</div>

<p>Tom Lewson had been an hour in camp before he began
the story of his wanderings, and at first, lying propped up
on one elbow, with the lamplight on his worn face, he
spoke slowly and with faltering tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We broke an oar coming off the beach that night, and
it kind of crippled us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Twice the boat nearly
went back again in the surf, and I don&#8217;t quite know how
we pulled her off. Anyway, one of us was busy heaving out
the water that broke into her. It was Jake, I think, and
he seemed kind of silly. Once we saw a boat hove up on a
sea, but we lost her in the spray, and a long while after we
saw the schooner. Just then a comber that broke on board
&#8217;most hove us over, and when we had dodged the next two
there wasn&#8217;t a sign of the schooner. After that we knew
that we were done, and we just tried to keep her head-to
and ease her to the seas.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped a moment, and looked around at the others
with troubled eyes, as if trying to marshal uncertain memories.
He was a simple sailorman, who contented himself
with the baldest narrative; still, two of those who heard
him could fill in the things he had not mentioned&mdash;the
mad lurching of the half-swamped boat, the tense struggle
with the oars each time a big frothing comber forged out
of the darkness, and the savage desperation of the drenched
and half-frozen men cast away with the roaring surf to lee
of them and their enemies watching upon the hammered
beach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It blew hard that night,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Somehow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
our little boat lived through it, but there wasn&#8217;t a sign of
the island when morning came&mdash;nothing but the combers
and the flying haze! Guess the wind must have shifted a
few points and drove us by the end of it. Then we found
Jake had his head laid open by a sealing club. The sea
was getting longer, and as we were too played out to hold
the boat to it we got her away before it, and somehow she
didn&#8217;t roll over. I think it was next day, though it might
have been longer, when we fetched another island. She
just washed up on it, and one of the others pulled me out.
There wasn&#8217;t a sign of anybody on the beach, but there
were plenty of skinned holluschickie seals on the slope behind
it, and that was fortunate for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You struck nobody on the island?&#8221; questioned Wyllard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Lewson answered simply. &#8220;The Russians
must have sent a vessel to take off the killers after the last
drive of the season a day or two before, for the holluschickie
were quite fresh. It was blowing hard and the
surf was getting steep, and the men had left quite a few
of their things behind them. We found the shacks that
the killers lived in, and we made out that winter in one
of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It occurred to Wyllard that this was a thing very few
men except sealers could have done had they been cast
ashore without stores or tools to face the awful winter of
the North.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get through?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; explained Lewson, &#8220;we had a rifle, and the
ca&#8217;tridges weren&#8217;t spoilt. The killers hadn&#8217;t taken their
cooking outfit, and by and by we got a walrus in an open
lane among the ice. They&#8217;d left some gear behind them,
but we were most of two days cutting and heaving the beast
out with a parbuckle under him. There was no trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
about things keeping in that frost. Besides, we&#8217;d the holluschickie
blubber to burn, and there was a half-empty bag
or two of stores in one of the shacks. No, we hadn&#8217;t any
great trouble in making out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You had to stay there until the ice broke up,&#8221; Charly
observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And after. The boat was gone, and we couldn&#8217;t get
away. She broke up in the surf, and we burned what we
saved of her. At last a schooner came along, and we hid
out across the island until she&#8217;d gone away. It was blowing
fresh, and hazy, and she just shoved a new gang of
killers ashore. There was an Okotsk Russian with them,
but he made no trouble for us. He was white, anyway,
and it kind of seemed to me he didn&#8217;t like one of the other
men who got hurt that night on the beach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then some of them did get badly hurt?&#8221; Wyllard
broke in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Lewson said, &#8220;from what that Russian told us&mdash;and
we got to understand each other after a time&mdash;one
of the killers had his ribs broke, and it seems that another
would go lame for life. Besides, among other things, there
was a white man got his face quite smashed. I saw him
with his nose flattened way out to starboard, and one eye
canted. He was a boss of some kind. They called him
Smirnoff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg looked up sharply. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; he commented,
&#8220;Smirnoff. A man with an unsavory name. I have
heard of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; Lewson went on, &#8220;we killed seals all the
open season with that Russian, and I&#8217;ve no fault to find
with him. In fact, I figure that if he could have fixed it
he&#8217;d have left us on the island that winter, but when a
schooner came to take the killers off and collect the skins
Smirnoff was on board of her. That&#8221;&mdash;an ominous gleam
crept into Lewson&#8217;s eyes&mdash;&#8220;was the real beginning of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
trouble. He had us hauled up before him&mdash;guess the other
man had to tell him who we were&mdash;and when I wouldn&#8217;t
answer he slashed me across the face with a dog whip.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lewson clenched a lean brown fist. &#8220;Yes&#8221; he added,
hoarsely, &#8220;I was whipped&mdash;but they should have tied my
hands first. It was not my fault I didn&#8217;t have that man&#8217;s
life. It was &#8217;most a minute before three of them pulled me
off him, and he was considerably worse to look at then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was silence for a minute or two, and Wyllard,
who felt his own face grow warm, saw the suggestive hardness
in Charly&#8217;s eyes. Lewson was gazing out into the
darkness, but the veins were swollen on his forehead and
his whole body had stiffened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that go. I can&#8217;t think of it,&#8221; he said, recovering
his composure. &#8220;They put us on board the schooner,
and by and by she ran into a creek on the coast. We were
to be sent somewhere to be dealt with, and we knew what
that meant, with what they had against us. Well, they
went ashore to collect some skins from the Kamtchadales,
and at night we cut the boat adrift. We got off in the
darkness, and if they followed they never trailed us. Guess
they figured we couldn&#8217;t make out through the winter that
was coming on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So far the story had been more or less connected and
comprehensible. It laid no great tax on Wyllard&#8217;s credulity,
and, indeed, all that Lewson described had come
about very much as Dampier had once or twice suggested;
but it seemed an almost impossible thing that the three
men should have survived during the years that followed.
Lewson, as it happened, never made that matter very clear.
He sat silent for almost a minute before he went on again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We hauled the boat out, and hid her among the rocks,
and after that we fell in with some Kamtchadales going
north,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They took us along, I don&#8217;t know how
far, but they were trapping for furs, and after a time&mdash;I think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
it was months after&mdash;we got away from them.
Then we fell in with another crowd, and went on further
north with them. They were Koriaks, and we lived with
them a long while&mdash;a winter and a summer anyway. It
was more, perhaps&mdash;I can&#8217;t remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off with a vague gesture, and sat looking at the
others vacantly with his lean face furrowed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have been with them two years&mdash;but I don&#8217;t
quite know. It was all the same up yonder&mdash;ever so far
to the north.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed to Wyllard that he had seldom heard anything
more expressive in its way than this sailorman&#8217;s brief
and fragmentary description of his life in the wilderness.
He had heard from whaler-skippers a little about the tundra
that fringes the Polar Sea, the vast desolation frozen
hard in summer a few inches below the surface, on which
nothing beyond the mosses ever grew. It was easy to understand
the brain-crushing sameness and monotony of an
existence checkered only by times of dire scarcity on those
lonely shores.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you live?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There were the birds in summer, and fish in the rivers.
In winter we killed things in the lanes in the ice, though
there were weeks when we lay about the blubber lamp in
the pits. They made pits and put a roof on them. I don&#8217;t
know why we staked there, but Jake had always a notion
that we might get across to Alaska&mdash;somehow. We were
way out on the ice one day when Jim fell into a crevice,
and we couldn&#8217;t get him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stopped, and sat still a while as one dreaming. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t put things together, but at last we came south, Jake
and I, and struck the Kamtchadales again. We could talk
to them, and one of them told us about a schooner lying in
an inlet by a settlement. The Russians had brought her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
there from the islands, and she must have been a sealer.
Jake figured it was just possible we might run away with
her and push across for the Aleutians or Alaska.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly looked up suddenly. &#8220;She&mdash;was&mdash;a sealer&mdash;Hayson&#8217;s
<i>Seminole</i>. I was in Victoria when we heard that
the Russians had seized her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard turned to Overweg, who nodded when he asked
a question in French.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I believe the vessel lies in the inlet
still. They have used her now and then. It is understood
that they were warranted in seizing her, but I think there
was some diplomatic pressure brought to bear on them, for
they sent her crew home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lewson went on again. &#8220;Food was scarce that season,
and we got &#8217;most nothing in the traps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Besides,
there were Russians out prospecting, and that headed us
off. We figured that some of the Kamtchadales who
traded skins to the settlements would put them on our trail.
When we went to look for the boat she&#8217;d gone, but we
hadn&#8217;t much notion of getting off in her, though another
time&mdash;I don&#8217;t remember when&mdash;we gave two Kamtchadales
messages we&#8217;d cut on slips of wood. Sometimes the schooners
stood in along the coast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard nodded. &#8220;Dunton of the <i>Cypress</i> got your
message,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was in difficulties then, but he
afterwards sent it me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Lewson, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t much more to it. We
hung about the beach a while, and then went north before
the winter. Jake played out on the trail. By and by
he had to let up, and in a day or two I buried him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His voice grew hoarse. &#8220;After that it didn&#8217;t seem to
matter what became of me, but I kept the trail somehow,
and found I couldn&#8217;t stay up yonder. That&#8217;s why I
started south with some of them before the summer came.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
Now I&#8217;m here&mdash;talking English&mdash;talking with white men&mdash;but
it doesn&#8217;t seem the same as it should have been&mdash;without
the others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He talked no more that night, but Wyllard translated
part of his story for the benefit of Overweg.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing, it seems incredible,&#8221; commented the scientist.
&#8220;This man, who has so little to tell, knows things
which would make a trained explorer famous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It generally happens that way,&#8221; said Wyllard. &#8220;The
men who know can&#8217;t tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg made a sign of assent, and then changed the
subject.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall you do now?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Start for the inlet, where we expect to find the schooner,
at sunrise. I want to say&#8221;&mdash;Wyllard hesitated&mdash;&#8220;that
you have laid an obligation on me which I can never repay;
but I can, at least, replace the provisions you have
given me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes for nothing,&#8221; declared Overweg, with a smile.
&#8220;I have, however, drawn upon my base camp rather heavily,
and should be glad of any stores from the schooner
that you could let me have. The difficulty is that I do not
wish to go too far toward the beach.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They arranged a rendezvous a few days&#8217; march from the
inlet, and in another half-hour all of them were fast asleep.
</p>
<p>When the first of the daylight came Wyllard set off
with his two companions, and since it was evident that
Dampier must have now lain in the inlet awaiting them
a considerable time, they marched fast for several days.
Then, to their consternation, they came upon the Siwash
lying beside a river badly lame. It appeared that in climbing
a slippery ridge of rock the knee he had injured had
given way, and he had fallen some distance heavily, after
which the Kamtchadale, finding him helpless, had disappeared
with most of the provisions. None of the party
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
ever learned what had become of the faithless courier, but
they realized that the situation was now a rather serious
one. Charly, who looked at Wyllard when he had heard
the Indian&#8217;s story, explained it concisely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worrying about the boat we left on the edge of the
ice,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had a notion all along it was going
to make trouble. Dampier would see the wreckage when
he ran in, and I guess it would only mean one thing to
him. He&#8217;d make quite certain he was right when he didn&#8217;t
find us at the inlet.&#8221; He paused and pointed towards the
distant sea. &#8220;You have got to push right on with Lewson
as fast as you can while I try to bring the Siwash
along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard started within the next few minutes, and afterward
never quite forgot the strain and stress of that arduous
march. The journey that he had made with Overweg
had been difficult enough, but they had then traversed
rising ground from which most of the melting snow had
drained away. Now, however, as they approached the
more level littoral there were wide tracts of mire and
swamp to be painfully floundered through, while every ravine
and hollow was swept by a frothing torrent, and they
had often to search for hours for a place where it was possible
to cross. To make things worse, they were drenched
with rain half the time, and trails of dingy mist obscured
their path, but they toiled on stubbornly through every
obstacles, though it was only by the tensest effort that Wyllard
kept pace with his companion. The gaunt, long-haired
Lewson seemed proof against physical weariness,
and there was seldom any change in the expression of his
grim, lined face. Now and then Wyllard felt a curious
shrinking as he glanced at Lewson, for his fixed look suggested
what he had borne in the awful solitudes of the
frozen North.
</p>
<p>Slowly, with infinite toil, they crossed the weary leagues,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
lying at night with a single skin between them and the
soil, for they traveled light. Wyllard was limping painfully,
with his boots worn off his feet, when one morning
they came into sight of a low promontory which rose
against a stretch of gray lifeless sea. His heart throbbed
fast as he realized that behind it lay the inlet into which
Dampier had arranged to bring the <i>Selache</i>. He glanced
at Lewson, who said nothing, and they plodded forward
faster than before.
</p>
<p>The misty sun was high in the heavens when they
reached the foot of the steep rise, and Wyllard gasped heavily
as they crept up the ascent. He was making a severe
muscular effort; but it was the nervous tension that
troubled him most, for he knew that he would look down
upon the inlet from the summit. He blamed himself bitterly
for not sending a messenger to Dampier immediately
after he fell in with Overweg. There had certainly been
difficulties in the way, for the increase in the scientist&#8217;s
party had made additional packers necessary, and Wyllard
felt that he could not reasonably compel the man who had
succored him to leave behind the camp comforts to which
he had evidently been accustomed. In spite of that, he
had been at fault in not disregarding every objection, and
he realized it now.
</p>
<p>Somehow he kept pace with Lewson, but he closed one
hand tight as he neared the top of the promontory. When
he reached the summit he stopped suddenly, and his face
set hard as he looked down. Beneath him lay a strip of
dim, green water, with a fringe of soft white surf, while
beyond the beach there stretched away an empty expanse
of slowly heaving sea. There was no schooner in the inlet,
no boat upon the beach.
</p>
<p>In another moment or two they went down the slope at
a stumbling run, and then stopped, gasping by the water&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
edge, and looked at one another. There were marks in
the sand which showed where a boat had been drawn up
not very long before. The <i>Selache</i> evidently had been
there, and had sailed away again.
</p>
<p>Wyllard sat down limply upon the shingle, for all the
strength seemed suddenly to melt out of him, and it was
several minutes before he looked up. Gazing out at sea,
Lewson was still standing, a shapeless, barbaric figure in
his garments of skins. The hide moccasins he wore had
chafed through, and Wyllard noticed that the blood was
trickling from one of his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Lewson asked harshly.
</p>
<p>Wyllard laid a stern restraint upon himself. Their case
looked desperate, but it must be grappled with.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go back and meet the rest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That
first&mdash;what is to come afterwards I don&#8217;t quite know.&#8221; A
faint gleam of resolution crept into his eyes. &#8220;The
schooner the Russians seized lies in an inlet down the
coast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lewson made a sign of comprehension. &#8220;There are
four of us. There will be birds by and by. I can trap
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He flung himself down near his comrade, and for an
hour neither of them spoke. Wyllard was worn out physically
and limp from the last few hours&#8217; mental strain,
while Lewson very seldom said more than was absolutely
necessary. They made a very frugal meal, and long afterwards
Wyllard was haunted by the memory of that dreary
afternoon during which he lay upon the shingle watching
the slow pulsations of the dim, lifeless sea.
</p>
<p>They set out again early next morning, and, as it happened,
found a little depôt of provisions that Dampier had
made, but it was several days before they met Charly and
the Indian, and another week had passed before Overweg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
reached the appointed meeting-place. The scientist listened
to Wyllard&#8217;s story gravely, and then appeared to consider.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have some plans?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Wyllard admitted that this was the case, and Overweg
smiled behind his spectacles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, perhaps, better that you should not tell me what
they are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is, however, one thing I can
do. You say you left some stores you could not carry at
the depôt, which I will take, for provisions are now not
plentiful with me, but at my base camp there are still a
few things you have not which are almost necessary, and&#8221;&mdash;he
made a gesture of reassuring significance&mdash;&#8220;after all,
if I have to go south a little earlier than I intended it is
not a great matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wrote on a strip of paper which he handed to Wyllard.
&#8220;You will take these, and nothing else. I may add
that Smirnoff is stationed at the inlet where the schooner
lies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard thanked him, and then looked him in the eyes.
&#8220;There is a long journey before us, and you have only
my word that I will take nothing but these things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overweg nodded quietly. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is perhaps
permissible to assure you that it is sufficient for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Little more was said, and in another half-hour Wyllard
and his companions were ready to set out. He and the
little spectacled scientist grasped each other&#8217;s hands, and
then Wyllard abruptly turned away. Looking back a few
minutes later, he saw Overweg standing upon the ridge
where he had left him, silhouetted against a low, gray sky.
The scientist raised his cap once, and Wyllard, who answered
him, swung around once more, and strode faster
towards the south.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE LAST EFFORT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was after a long and arduous journey which had left its
mark on all of them that Wyllard and his companions, one
lowering evening, lay among the boulders beside a sheltered
inlet waiting for the dusk to fall. They were cramped
and aching, for they had scarcely moved during the last
hour. Their garments were badly tattered, and their half-covered
feet were bleeding. With three knives and one
rifle among them they were a pitiful company to seize a
vessel, but there was resolution in their haggard faces.
</p>
<p>Close in front of them the green water lapped softly
among the stones. The breeze was light off shore, and the
tide, which was just running ebb, rippled against the bows
of a little schooner lying some thirty yards from the bank.
The vessel had been seized for illegal sealing some years
earlier, and it was evident that she had been little used
since then. The paint was peeling from her cracked and
weathered side, her gear was frayed and bleached with
frost and rain, and only very hardpressed men would have
faced the thought of going to sea in her. Wyllard and his
companions were, however, very hardpressed indeed, and
they preferred the hazards of a voyage in the crazy vessel
to falling into the Russians&#8217; hands. It was also clear that
they had no choice. It must be either one thing or the
other.
</p>
<p>Some little distance up stream a low hill cut against the
dingy sky. It shut off all of the upper part of the inlet
which wound in behind it, but Wyllard and his companions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
had cautiously climbed the slope earlier in the afternoon,
and, lying flat upon the summit, had looked down upon the
little wooden houses that clustered above the beach. He
had then decided that this part of the inlet would dry out
at about half-ebb, and as the schooner&#8217;s boat, which he
meant to seize lay upon the shingle, it was evident that
he must carry out his plans within the next three hours.
</p>
<p>These plans were very simple. There was nobody on
board the schooner, which lay in deeper water, and he believed
that it would be possible to swim off to her and slip
the cable; but they must have provisions, and there was,
so far as he could see, only one way of obtaining them.
A building which stood by itself close beside the beach was
evidently a store, for he had seen two men carrying bags
and cases out of it under the superintendence of a third in
some kind of uniform, and it appeared to be unguarded.
Wyllard had reasons for surmising that the store contained
Government supplies, and had arranged that Charly and
Lewson should break into it as soon as darkness fell. They
were to pull off to the schooner with anything they could
find inside. Whether they would succeed in doing this he
did not know, and he admitted to himself that it scarcely
seemed probable, but he could think of no other plan, and
the attempt must be made.
</p>
<p>A thin haze drove across the crest of the hill, the breeze
freshened slightly, and the little ripples lapped more noisily
along the shingle. There was evidently a great deal
of fresh water coming down the inlet, and it was in a fever
of impatience he watched the schooner strain at her cable.
That evening had already seemed the longest he had ever
spent in his life. By and by it began to rain, and little
streams of chilly water trickled about the weary men, but
they lay still, with lips tight set in tense suspense. What
Lewson had had to face in the awful icy wastes to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
north of them Wyllard could scarcely imagine, and Lewson
could not tell, but he and his two other comrades had
borne things almost beyond endurance since he began his
search, and now there was far too much at stake for him
to increase the odds against them by any undue precipitancy.
He was then in a dangerous mood, but he had laid
his plans with grim, cold-blooded caution, and he meant
to adhere to them.
</p>
<p>Very slowly the light faded, until the beach grew shadowy,
and the schooner&#8217;s spars and rigging showed dim and
blurred against a dusky background. The rise that shut
off the settlement was lost in drifting haze, and the dull
rumble of the surf on the outer beach came up more sharply
through the gathering darkness. The measured beat of the
tide&#8217;s deep pulsations almost maddened Wyllard as he lay
and listened, for if all went right, in an hour or two he
would be sliding out over the long heave with every sail
piled on to the crazy schooner.
</p>
<p>When there was only a faint gleam of water sliding by
below, he rose stiffly to his feet, and Lewson stretched out
a hand for the rifle that lay among the stones. There was
a sharp click as he jerked the lever, and then he laughed,
a little jarring laugh, as the magazine snapped back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll treat us as pirates if they get hands on us&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve been lashed in the face&mdash;with a sled-dog-whip,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>Charly made no remark as he loosed the long seaman&#8217;s
knife in his belt. Wyllard could not utter a remonstrance,
for there is, as he recognized, a point beyond which prudence
does not count. After what Overweg had once or
twice told him, it was unthinkable that they should fall
into Smirnoff&#8217;s hands.
</p>
<p>Lewson and Charly melted away into the darkness.
Wyllard and the Siwash walked quietly down to the water&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
edge, a little up-stream of the schooner, as the stream was
running strong. As they waited a few moments before
plunging into the sea they stripped off nothing, for it was
evident that none of the rags they left behind could be replaced,
and they knew from experience that when the first
shock is over a man swimming in icy water is kept a little
warmer by his clothing. For all that, the cold struck
through Wyllard when he flung himself forward and swung
his left hand out. It was perhaps a minute before he was
clearly conscious of anything beyond the physical agony
and the mental effort to retain control of his faculties.
Then he made out the schooner, a vague, blurred shape a
little down-stream, and he swam furiously, his face dipping
under each time his left hand came out.
</p>
<p>He drew level with the vessel, clutched at her cable, a
foot short, and was driven against her bows. The stream
swept him onward, gasping, and clawing savagely at the
slippery side of the schooner, until his fingers found a hold.
It was merely the rounded top of a bolt that he touched,
but with a desperate effort he clutched the bent iron that
led up from it to one of the dead-eyes of the mainmast-shrouds.
He could not, however, draw himself up any further,
and he hung on, wondering when his strength would
fail him. The Siwash, who had crawled up the cable,
leaned down from above and seized his shoulder. In another
moment he reached the rail, and went staggering
across the deck, dripping and half-dazed.
</p>
<p>Action was imperatively necessary, and he braced himself
for the effort. The schooner was lying with her anchor
up-stream, but he did not think it would be possible
to heave her over it and break it out unless he waited until
the others arrived, and it would then be a lengthy and,
what was more to the purpose, a noisy operation. The
anchor must be sacrificed, but there was the difficulty that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
in the dark he could hardly expect to find a shackle on the
cable. Running forward with the Siwash, he pulled out a
chain stopper, and then shipping the windlass levers found
with vast relief that it would work. It would make a horribly
distinct clanking, he knew, but that could not be
helped, and the next thing was to discover whether the end
of the chain was made fast below, for it is very seldom that
a skipper finds it necessary to pay out all his cable.
</p>
<p>Dropping into the darkness of the locker beneath the
forecastle, he was more fortunate than he could reasonably
have expected to be, for as he crawled over the rusty links
he felt a shackle. It appeared to be of the usual harp-pattern
with a cottered pin, and he called out sharply to
the Siwash, who presently flung him an iron bar and a big
spike. He struck one of the two or three sulphur matches
he had carefully treasured, and when the sputtering blue
flame went out set to work to back the pin out in the dark.
He smashed his knuckles and badly bruised his hands, but
he succeeded, and knew that he had shortened the chain by
two-thirds now.
</p>
<p>He scrambled up on deck again and hurried aft for
the vessel&#8217;s kedge had been laid out astern to prevent her
swinging. There was a heavy hemp warp attached to it,
and it cost them some time to heave most of it over, after
which they proceeded to get the mainsail on to her. It was
covered with a coat, and Wyllard cut himself as he slashed
through the tiers in savage impatience. Then he and the
Siwash toiled at the halliards desperately, for the task of
raising the heavy gaff was almost beyond their powers.
</p>
<p>There was no grease on the mast-hoops; the blocks evidently
had not been used for months. Several times they
desisted a moment or two, gasping, breathless, and utterly
exhausted. Still, foot by foot they got the black canvas up,
and then, leaving the peak hanging, ran forward to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
boom-foresail, which was smaller and lighter. They set that,
cast two jibs and the staysail loose, and let them lie. Wyllard
sat down feeling that the thing they had done would,
if attempted in cold blood, have appeared almost impossible.
It was done, however, and now he must wait until
the boat appeared. There was no sign of her, and as he
gazed up the inlet, seeing only the glimmer of the water
and the sliding mist, the suspense became almost intolerable.
Minute after minute slipped by, and still nothing
loomed out of the haze. The canvas rustled and banged
above him, there was a growing splashing beneath the bows,
and the schooner strained more heavily at her cable.
Everything was ready, only his comrades did not appear.
He clenched his hands and set his lips as he waited. He
wondered at the Siwash, who sat upon the rail, a dim,
shapeless figure, impassively still.
</p>
<p>At last his heart leaped, for a faint splash of oars came
out of the darkness. Both men ran forward to the windlass.
The sharp clanking it made drowned the splash of
oars, but in another minute or two there was a crash as
the boat drove alongside, and Charly scrambled up with
a rope while Lewson hurled sundry bags and cases after
him. Then he climbed on deck in turn, and Charly began
a breathless explanation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all we could get. There&#8217;s nobody on our trail,&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>The last fact was most important, and Wyllard cut him
short. &#8220;Get the jibs and staysail on to her,&#8221; he commanded.
</p>
<p>The new arrivals worked rapidly while the cable clanked
and rattled as the schooner drove astern, but at the first
heave the rotten staysail tore off the hanks, and one jib
burst as they ran it up its stay. For an anxious moment
or two the cable jammed, and the anchor brought the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
schooner up. All four flung themselves upon the windlass
levers, and after a furious effort the chain came up again
and ran out faster, fathom by fathom, rattling horribly,
until the end of it shot suddenly over the windlass. Then
there was another check as the schooner brought up by the
kedge swung suddenly across the stream.
</p>
<p>Her banging canvas filled, she listed over, and it was evident
to all of them that if the kedge started she would
forthwith drive ashore. Tense with strain, its warp ripped
out of the water, and she was swinging on it heading for
the beach when Wyllard flung himself upon the wheel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang on to every inch or break it!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Out
main-boom; box your jib and staysail up to weather!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In desperate haste they obeyed orders, amid a great clatter
of blocks and thrashing of canvas, while Wyllard
wrenched up his helm, and the schooner, straining on the
warp, fell away with her bows down-stream. The sweat
of effort dripped from Wyllard when he swung up an arm
to Lewson, who was standing at the bollard to which the
warp was made fast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; he cried hoarsely, &#8220;let her go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rope fell with a splash, the schooner lurched forward
and drove away down the inlet with the stream running
seaward under her, while Wyllard felt a trifle dazed from
sheer revulsion of feeling. The rumble of the surf was
growing louder; the deck slanted slightly beneath him. If
they could keep her off the beach for the next few minutes
there was freedom before them! He hazarded a glance
astern, but could see no sign of a boat up the inlet. They
had done a thing which even then appeared almost incredible.
</p>
<p>The breeze came down fresher, the gurgle at the bows
grew louder, and the deck began to heave with a slow and
regular rise and fall. A long, shadowy point girt about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
with spectral surf slipped by, and they were out in open
water. They ran the schooner out for an hour or two and
then, though the peak of the mainsail burst to tatters as
they hauled her on a wind, let her stretch away northward
following the trend of coast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stand on as she&#8217;s lying until we find a creek or
river mouth. We must have water,&#8221; Wyllard said.
</p>
<p>An hour later he called Charly to the wheel, and sitting
down in the shelter of the rail, went to sleep, though this
was about the last thing he had contemplated doing. It
was gray dawn when he opened his eyes again, and aching
all over and very cold, stood up to see that the schooner was
tumbling over a spiteful sea with the hazy loom of land not
far away from her. He glanced at the gear and canvas,
and was almost appalled, while Charly, who was busy close
by, saw his face and grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to look at her too much,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;We took a swig on the peak-halliards a little while ago,
and had to let up before we pulled the gaff off her. Boom-foresail&#8217;s
worse, and the jibs are dropping off her, while
the water just pours in through her top-sides when she puts
another lee plank down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made an expressive gesture, and leaned upon
the rail. He realized then something of the nature of the
task he had undertaken. They had no anchor, no fresh
water, no fuel for cooking, and, so far as he was aware,
very few provisions, while it seemed to him that the weathered,
worn-out gear would not hold the masts in the vessel
in any weight of breeze. Still, the thing must be attempted,
and there was one want, at least, that could be
supplied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll beat her in. When we come
abreast of the first creek you and Tom and the Siwash will
go ashore.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was afternoon when they sighted a little stream,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
and they took most of the canvas off the vessel before three
of them pulled away in the boat, leaving Wyllard at the
helm. It was blowing moderately fresh off shore, and it
was with feverish impatience that he watched them toiling
at the oars, two of them pulling while the third man sculled.
They disappeared behind a point, and an anxious hour went
by before the boat, which now showed a very scanty strip
of side above the tumbling foam, crept out from the beach
again. Having no breakers, they had brought the water
off in bulk, sitting in it as they pulled, and it was fortunate
that the boat lurched off shore easily before the little
splashing seas. They lost some of the water before they
hove it into the big rusty tank, and then they held a consultation
when they had swung the boat in and the schooner
was running off to the east again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve about stores enough to last two weeks&mdash;that is,
if you don&#8217;t expect too much,&#8221; Lewson pointed out.
&#8220;There&#8217;s an American stove in the deck-house, and while
we can&#8217;t find anything meant to burn in it there&#8217;s an ax
down forward, and we could cut out cabin floorings, or a
beam or two, without taking too much stiffening out of
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard, who had inspected the stores, knew that a fortnight
was the very longest that could be counted on, though
they ate no more than would keep a modicum of strength
in them. From their kind and quality he surmised that
the provisions had been intended for the officials in charge
of the settlement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get them, Tom?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing;&#8221; said Lewson quietly, &#8220;was simple. It
was dark and hazy, and raining quite hard. The first thing
we did was to run the boat down and leave her nearly
afloat. Then we crawled back, and lay by listening outside
that store. We were figuring how we were to break it
in when two men came along. They went in and came out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
with a bag or two, and as they left the door open we figured
they were coming back for more. We humped out a
moderate load, and had just got it down to the boat when
we saw those men, or two others, in the haze. I was for
lying by, but Charly would get out then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Charly laughed dryly. &#8220;He wanted to take the rifle
and go back to look for Smirnoff. I&#8217;d no use for any
trouble of that kind, and I shoved the boat off while he was
seeing how many ca&#8217;tridges there were in the magazine.
He waded in and grabbed the boat when he saw I was sure
going, but I shoved her away from him. Then it kind of
struck him he had to get in or swim.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lewson&#8217;s expression grew grim. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing that
hurts the most&mdash;to go away before I got even with that
man,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Still, I may get over it if I try to
think of him with his nose smashed hard to starboard.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard made a sign of impatience. He felt that, after
all, there was perhaps something to be said for Smirnoff&#8217;s
point of view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is just one plan open to us, and that&#8217;s to drive
the schooner across to the eastward as fast as we can,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We might, perhaps, pick up an Alaska C. C. factory
before the provisions quite run out if this breeze and
the gear hold up. Failing that, we must try for one of the
Western Aleutians.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others concurred in this, and very fortunately the
breeze kept to the west and south, for Wyllard had very
grave doubts as to whether he could have thrashed the
schooner to windward through a steep head sea. Indeed,
on looking back on that voyage and remembering the state
of the vessel, it seemed to him that he and his companions
had escaped as by a miracle. In any case, they hove the
vessel to, one misty evening, in a deep inlet behind a promontory,
and Wyllard, who sculled up the inlet alone in the
growing darkness, badly startled the agent of an A.C.C.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
factory when he appeared, ragged, haggard, and wet with
rain, in the doorway of a big, stove-warmed room.
</p>
<p>The agent, however, was out for business, but when Wyllard
produced a wad of paper money stained by wet and
perspiration he appeared quite willing to part with certain
provisions. He was told that no questions would be answered,
and when he had given his visitor supper, Wyllard
sculled away in the darkness leaving him none the wiser.
Half an hour later the schooner slipped out to sea again.
</p>
<p>The rest was by comparison easy. They had the coast of
Alaska and British Columbia close aboard, and they crept
southwards in fine weather, once running off their course
when the smoke of a steamer crept up above the horizon.
In a strong breeze, they ran for the northern tongue of
Vancouver Island, and Wyllard, who had already decided
that the vessel would fetch scarcely five hundred dollars,
and that it would be better if all trace of her disappeared,
pulled his wheel over suddenly as she was scraping by a
surf-swept reef.
</p>
<p>In another minute she was on hard and fast, and they
had scarcely got the boat over when the masts went with a
crash. A quarter of an hour later the wreckage was thrown
up on the beach, and, before they set out on a long march
through the bush, there was very little to be seen of the
vessel.
</p>
<p>Three or four days afterward they reached a little
wooden town, and Wyllard, who slipped into it alone in
the dusk, bought clothing for himself and his companions,
who put it on in the bush. Then they went into the town
together, and slept that night in a hotel.
</p>
<p>Their troubles were over, and, what was more, Wyllard,
who pledged the rest to secrecy, fancied that what had become
of the schooner would remain a mystery.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>WYLLARD COMES HOME</h3>
</div>

<p>Harvest had commenced at the Range, and the clashing
binders were moving through the grain when Hawtrey sat
one afternoon in Wyllard&#8217;s room. It was about five
o&#8217;clock, and every man belonging to the homestead
was toiling, bare-armed and grimed with dust, among
the yellow oats, but Hawtrey sat at a table gazing with a
troubled face at the litter of papers in front of him. He
wore a white shirt and store clothes, which was distinctly
unusual in case of a Western farmer at harvest time, and
Edmonds, the mortgage-jobber, leaned back in a big chair
quietly watching him.
</p>
<p>Edmonds had called at a singularly inconvenient time,
and Hawtrey was anxious to get rid of him before the arrival
of the guests that he expected. It was Sally&#8217;s birthday,
and, since she took pleasure in simple festivities of
any kind, he had arranged to celebrate it at the Range.
He was, however, sufficiently acquainted with the money-lender&#8217;s
character to realize that it was most unlikely that
he would take his departure before he had accomplished the
purpose which had brought him there. This was to collect
several thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>It was quite clear to Hawtrey that he was in an unpleasantly
tight place. Edmonds held a bond upon his homestead,
teams and implements as security for a short date
loan, repayment of which was due, and he was to be married
to Sally in a month or so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you wait a little?&#8221; he asked at length.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; was the uncompromising reply.
&#8220;Money&#8217;s tight this fall, and things have gone against me.
Besides, you could pay me off if you wanted to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds turned toward an open window, and glanced
at the great stretch of yellow grain that ran back across
the prairie. Dusty teams and binders with flashing wooden
arms moved half-hidden along the edge of the vast field,
and the still, clear air was filled with a clash and clatter
and the rustle of flung-out sheaves.
</p>
<p>There was no doubt that money could be raised upon
that harvest field. Indeed, Hawtrey fancied that his companion
would be quite content to take a bond for the delivery
of so many thousand bushels in repayment of the
loan, but while he had already gone further than he had
at one time contemplated doing, this was a course he shrank
from suggesting. After all, the grain was Wyllard&#8217;s, and
there was the difficulty that Wyllard might still come back.
If Wyllard failed to return, an absence of another few
months would entitle his executors to consider him dead.
In either case, Hawtrey would be required to account for
his property.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he decided, &#8220;I can&#8217;t take&mdash;that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a trace of contempt in the mortgage-jobber&#8217;s
smile. &#8220;You of course understand just how you&#8217;re fixed,
but it seemed to me from that draft of the arrangement
with Wyllard that you have the power to do pretty much
what you like. Anyway, if you gave me a bond on as
much of that grain as would wipe out the loan at the present
figure, it would only mean that you would have Wyllard&#8217;s
trustees for creditors instead of me, and it&#8217;s probable
that they wouldn&#8217;t be as hard upon you as I&#8217;m compelled
to be. As things stand, you have got to square up or I
throw your place on the market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey&#8217;s face betrayed his dismay; and Edmonds believed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
that he would yield to a little further pressure.
Gregory had not said anything about the mortgage to
Sally, and it would be extremely unpleasant to be turned
out upon the prairie within a month or two of his marriage,
for he could not count upon being left in possession of the
Range much longer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only entitled to handle Wyllard&#8217;s money on his account,&#8221;
he objected.
</p>
<p>Edmonds appeared to reflect. &#8220;So far as I can remember
there was nothing of that kind stated in the draft of
the arrangement. It empowered you to do anything you
thought fit with the money, but it&#8217;s altogether your own
affair. I can, of course, get my money back by selling your
homestead, and I must decide if that must be done or not
before I leave.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds had very little doubt as to what the decision
would be. Hawtrey would yield, and afterwards it would
not be difficult to draw him into some unwise speculation
with the object of getting the money back, which he imagined
that Hawtrey would be desperately anxious to do. As
the result of this, he expected to get such a hold upon the
Range that he would be master of the situation when the
property fell into the hands of Wyllard&#8217;s trustees. That
Hawtrey would be disgraced as well as ruined naturally
did not count with him.
</p>
<p>Gregory took up one of the papers, and read it through.
Then he rose, and stood leaning on the table while he gazed
at the teams toiling amid the grain. There was wealth
enough yonder to release him from his torturing anxieties,
and after all, he felt, something must turn up before the
reckoning was due. It was not in his nature to face a
crisis, and with him a trouble seemed less formidable if it
could only be put off a little. Edmonds, who knew with
what kind of man he had to deal, said nothing further, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
quietly reached out for another cigar. He saw vacillation
in his victim&#8217;s manner.
</p>
<p>Meantime, though neither of the men were aware of it,
Sally had alighted from her wagon on the other side of the
house, and two other vehicles were growing larger upon the
sweep of whitened prairie. As she entered the homestead
the girl met Mrs. Nansen, who informed her that Hawtrey
was busy with Edmonds in Wyllard&#8217;s room. Sally&#8217;s eyes
sparkled when she heard it, and her face grew hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That man!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll go
right in to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In another minute she opened the door, and answered
the mortgage-jobber&#8217;s embarrassed greeting with a frigid
stare. Having had some experience with Sally&#8217;s uncompromising
directness, he was inclined to fancy that the
game was up, but he waited calmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this man doing here again?&#8221; Sally asked, fixing
her eyes on Hawtrey. &#8220;You promised me you would
never make another deal with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gregory flushed. Had he thought it would be the least
use he would have made some attempt to get Sally out of
the room, but he was unpleasantly sure that unless she was
fully satisfied first it would only result in failure. Driven
to desperation, as he was, he had a half-conscious feeling
that she might provide him with some means of escape.
Sally had certainly saved him once, and, humiliating as
the thought was, he had an idea that she did not expect too
much from him. She might be very angry, but Sally&#8217;s
anger was, after all, less difficult to face than Agatha&#8217;s
quiet scorn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t made another deal. It&#8217;s&mdash;a previous one,&#8221;
Gregory explained lamely.
</p>
<p>Sally swung around on Edmonds. &#8220;You have come
here for money? You may as well tell me. I won&#8217;t leave
you with Gregory until you do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>It was quite evident that she would make her promise
good, and Edmonds nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;about three thousand dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Gregory can&#8217;t pay you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds thought rapidly, and decided to take a bold
course. He was acquainted with Hawtrey&#8217;s habit of putting
things off, and fancied that his debtor would seize
upon the first loophole of escape from an embarrassing situation.
That was why he gave him a lead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is a way in which he could do
it if he wished. He has only to fill in a paper and hand
it to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Edmonds had not sufficiently counted on Sally&#8217;s knowledge
of his victim&#8217;s affairs, or her quickness of wit, for
she turned to Hawtrey with a commanding gesture.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going to get three thousand dollars
from?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>The blood rushed into Hawtrey&#8217;s face, for this was a
thing he could not tell her; but a swift suspicion, flashed
into her mind as she looked at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it could be&mdash;raised,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To pay this mortgage off?&#8221; Sally swung round on Edmonds
now, as she questioned him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;he can easily do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the girl turned to Hawtrey. &#8220;Gregory,&#8221; she said
with harsh incisiveness, &#8220;there&#8217;s only one way you could
get that money&mdash;and it isn&#8217;t yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey made no reply. He could not meet her gaze,
and when he turned from her she looked back at the mortgage-broker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re gone before I come back there&#8217;ll sure be
trouble,&#8221; she informed him, and sped swiftly out of the
room.
</p>
<p>Hawtrey sat down limply in his chair, and Edmonds
laughed in a jarring manner. The game was up, but, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
all, if he got his three thousand dollars he could be satisfied,
for one way or another he had already extracted a
great deal of money from Hawtrey.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you I&#8217;d marry that girl right away,&#8221; Edmonds
advised Hawtrey. &#8220;You&#8217;d be safer if you had her
to look after you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hawtrey let the jibe pass. For one thing, he felt that
it was warranted, and just then his anxiety was too strong
for anger.
</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Sally had run out of the house to
meet Hastings, who had just handed his wife down
from their wagon. The girl drew him a pace or two
aside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about Gregory,&#8221; she said; &#8220;he&#8217;s in trouble&mdash;big
trouble. Somehow we have got to raise three thousand
dollars. Edmonds is inside with him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings did not seem surprised. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I
guess it&#8217;s over that mortgage of his. It would be awkward
for you and Gregory if Edmonds took the homestead and
turned him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally&#8217;s face grew white, but she met his gaze steadily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;that&#8217;s not what I would mind the
most.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings reflected a moment or two. He thought that it
was a very difficult admission for the girl to make, and that
she had made it suggested that Hawtrey might become involved
in more serious difficulties. He had also a strong
suspicion of what they were likely to be.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally,&#8221; questioned Hastings quietly, &#8220;you are afraid
of Edmonds making him do something you would not
like?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though she did not answer directly, he saw the shame
in the girl&#8217;s face, and remembered that he was one of
Wyllard&#8217;s trustees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must raise that money&mdash;now&mdash;and I don&#8217;t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
where to get more than five hundred dollars from. I
might manage that,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Hastings, &#8220;you want me to lead you
then, and I&#8217;m not sure that I can. Still, if you&#8217;ll wait a
few minutes I&#8217;ll see what I can do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sally left him, and he turned to his wife, whose expression
suggested that she had overheard part of what was
said and had guessed the rest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to raise that money? After all, we are
friends of his, and it may save him from letting Edmonds
get his grip upon the Range,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Hastings made a sign of reluctant assent. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
quite know how I can do it personally, in view of the figure
wheat is standing at, and I don&#8217;t think much of any
security that Gregory could offer me. Still, there is, perhaps,
a way in which it could be arranged, and it&#8217;s one that,
considering everything, is more or less admissible. I think
I&#8217;ll wait here for Agatha.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha was in the wagon driven by Sproatly. When
Sproatly had helped her and Winifred to alight, Hastings,
who walked to the house with them, drew Agatha into an
unoccupied room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid that Gregory&#8217;s in rather serious trouble.
Sally seems very anxious about him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s rather
a delicate subject, but I understand that in a general way
you are on good terms with both of them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha met his embarrassed gaze with a smile. She
knew that what he really wished to discover was whether
she still felt any bitterness against Gregory or blamed him
for pledging himself to Sally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;Sally and I are good friends, and
I am very sorry to hear that Gregory is in any difficulty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hastings still seemed embarrassed, and she was becoming
puzzled by his manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Once upon a time you would have done anything possible
to make things easier for him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wonder
if I might ask if to some extent you have that feeling
still?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. If he is in serious trouble I should be glad
to do anything within my power to help him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it cost, we will say, about six hundred English
pounds?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha gazed at him in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some twenty dollars in my possession which
your wife handed me not long ago,&#8221; she remarked in a puzzled
tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, if you had the money, you would be glad to help
him&mdash;and would not regret it afterwards?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; asserted Agatha decisively; &#8220;if I had the means,
and the need was urgent, I should be glad to do what I
could.&#8221; Then she laughed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand in the
least how this is to the purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will wait for the next two or three months I
may be able to explain it to you,&#8221; replied Hastings. &#8220;In
the meanwhile, there are one or two things I have to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he left her, Agatha sat still, wondering what he
could have meant, but feeling that she would be willing to
do what she could for Gregory. Hastings&#8217; suggestion that
it was possible that she still cherished any sense of grievance
against him because he was going to marry Sally,
brought a scornful smile to her lips. It was easy to forgive
Gregory that, for she now saw him as he was&mdash;shallow,
careless, shiftless, a man without depth of character. He
had a few surface graces, and on occasion a certain half-insolent
forcefulness of manner which in a curious fashion
was almost becoming. There was, however, nothing beneath
the surface. He was, it seemed, quite willing that
a woman should help him out of the trouble in which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
had involved himself, for she had no doubt that Sally had
sent Hastings on his incomprehensible errand.
</p>
<p>Then a clear voice came in through the window, and
turning towards it Agatha discovered that a young lad clad
in blue duck was singing as he drove his binder through
the grain. The song was a simple one which had some
vogue just then upon the prairie, but her eyes grew suddenly
hazy as odd snatches of it reached her through the
beat of hoofs, the clash of the binder&#8217;s arms and the rustle
of the flung-out sheaves.
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;My Bonny lies over the ocean,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>My Bonny lies over the sea.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The youth called to his horses, and it was a few moments
before she heard again&mdash;
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Bring back my Bonny to me.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>A quiver ran through her as she leaned upon the window
frame. There was a certain pathos in the simple strain,
and she could fancy that the lad, who was clearly English,
as an exile felt it, too. Once more as the jaded horses and
clashing machine grew smaller down the edge of the great
sweep of yellow grain, his voice came faintly up to her with
its haunting thrill of longing and regret&mdash;
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Bring back my Bonny to me.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>This in her case was more than anyone could do, and
as she stood listening a tear splashed upon her closed
hands. The man, by comparison with whom Gregory appeared
a mere lay figure, was in all probability lying still
far up in the solitudes of the frozen North, with his last
grim journey done. This time, however, he had not carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
her picture with him. Gregory was to blame for that,
and it was the one thing she could not forgive him.
</p>
<p>She leaned against the window for another minute, struggling
with an almost uncontrollable longing, and looking
out upon the sweep of golden wheat and whitened grass
with brimming eyes, until there was a rattle of wheels, and
she saw Edmonds drive away. She heard voices in the
corridor, and it became evident that Hastings was speaking
to his wife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got rid of the man, and it&#8217;s reasonable to expect
that Gregory will keep clear of him after this,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you mean that Agatha did it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Hastings who asked the question, and Agatha
became intent as she heard her name. She did not,
however, hear the answer, and Mrs. Hastings spoke again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Allen,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you don&#8217;t keep a secret badly,
though Harry pledged you not to tell. Still, all that caution
was a little unnecessary. It was, of course, just the
kind of thing he would do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221; Hastings asked, and Agatha heard
Mrs. Hastings&#8217; soft laugh, for they were just outside the
door now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Left the Range, or most of it, to Agatha in case he
didn&#8217;t come back again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went on, and Agatha, turning from the window,
sat down limply with the blood in her face and her heart
beating fast. Wyllard&#8217;s last care, it seemed, had been to
provide for her, and that fact brought her a curious sense
of solace. In an unexplainable fashion it took the bitterest
sting out of her grief, though how far he had succeeded
in his intentions did not seem to matter in the least..
It was sufficient to know that amid all the haste of his
preparation he had not forgotten her.
</p>
<p>Becoming a little calmer, she understood what had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
in Hastings&#8217; mind during the interview that had puzzled
her, and was glad that she assured him of her willingness
to sacrifice anything that might be hers if it was needed
to set Gregory free. It was, she felt, what Wyllard would
have done with the money. He had said that Gregory was
a friend of his, and that, she knew, meant a great deal to
him.
</p>
<p>She suddenly realized that she must join the others if
she did not wish her absence to excite comment. Going
out, she came face to face with Sally in the corridor. The
girl stopped, and saw the sympathy in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said impulsively, &#8220;I&#8217;ve saved him. Edmonds
has gone. Hastings bought him off, and, though I
don&#8217;t quite know how, you helped him. He stayed behind
to wait for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha smiled. The vibrant relief in her companion&#8217;s
voice stirred her, and she realized once more that in choosing
this half-taught girl Gregory had acted with a wholly
unusual wisdom. It was with a sense of half-contemptuous
amusement at her own folly that she remembered how
she had once fancied that Gregory was marrying beneath
him. Sally was far from perfect, but in the essentials the
man was not fit to brush her shoes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; responded Agatha, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know
exactly what I&mdash;have&mdash;done, but if it amounts to anything
it is a pleasure to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went together into the big general room where
Gregory was talking to Winifred somewhat volubly. Agatha,
however, judged from his manner that he had, at least,
the grace to feel ashamed of himself. Supper, she heard
Mrs. Nansen say, would be ready very shortly, and feeling
in no mood for general conversation, she sat near a window
looking out across the harvest field until she heard a distant
shout, and saw a wagon appear on the crest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
hill. To her astonishment, two of the binders stopped,
and she saw the men who sprang down from them run to
meet the wagon. In another moment or two more of the
teams stopped, and a faint clamor of cries went up, while
here and there little running figures straggled up the slope.
All the occupants of the room clustered about her at the
window, and Winifred turned to Hastings.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they shouting for?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;They are
all crowding about the wagon now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Agatha felt suddenly dazed and dizzy, for she knew what
the answer to that question must be even before Mrs. Hastings
spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Harry coming back!&#8221; she gasped.
</p>
<p>In another moment they all hastened out of the house,
and Agatha found it scarcely possible to follow them, for
the sudden revulsion of feeling had almost overpowered
her. Still, she reached the door, and saw the wagon drawn
up amid a cluster of struggling men. Presently Wyllard,
whom they surrounded, broke from them. She stood on
the threshold waiting for him, and in the moment of her
exultation a pang smote her as she saw how gaunt and
worn he was. He came straight toward her, apparently
regardless of the others, and, clasping the hands she held
out, drew her into the house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have not married Gregory yet?&#8221; he questioned,
and laughed triumphantly when he saw the answer in her
shining eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;it is certain that I will never
marry him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wyllard drew her back still further with a compelling
grasp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>Agatha looked up at him, and then turned her eyes away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was waiting for you,&#8221; she said simply.
